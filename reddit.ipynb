I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company\\'s products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.\\n\\n**About Uber:**\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about Uber\\'s debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I\\'m going to tell you why these things don\\'t even matter.\\n\\nRecently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You\\'d assume this will cut into Uber\\'s profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What\\'s crazy is that they\\'re now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\\\\_uber\\\\_2088\\\\_minimum\\\\_pay\\\\_is\\\\_not\\\\_what\\\\_you\\\\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)\\n\\nAfter going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they\\'re actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I\\'m dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it\\'s customers and charging them a bogus \"service fee\", instead of getting mad at Uber they\\'re getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new \"service fee\" they\\'re paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I\\'ve been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they\\'re pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don\\'t want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.\\n\\nI love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don\\'t give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they\\'re damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you\\'re going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.\\n\\n**Again, I don\\'t read balance sheets ever. Please do inform me on why it matters and why Uber is NOT A GOOD BUY.**'}\n",

Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a\\xa0**timber-trading company**.\\n\\nAlthough it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.\\n\\nAs I’m writing this, its share price is\\xa0**down over 70%**\\xa0from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n  \\n**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**\\n\\n***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***\\n\\nThe company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by\\xa0**acquiring**\\xa0many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.\\n\\n***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***\\n\\nIn 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:\\n\\n* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)\\n* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)\\n* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)\\n* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)\\n* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)\\n\\nThe transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of\\xa0**Gucci Group,**\\xa0100% of\\xa0**Boucheron,**\\xa0and 100% of\\xa0**Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.\\n\\nFrançois-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.\\n\\nIt is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).\\n\\nIts portfolio is quite diversified and includes:\\n\\n* High-end clothing\\n* Footwear\\n* Handbags and leather goods\\n* Sunglasses and eyewear\\n* Scarves & other fashion accessories\\n* Jewelry\\n* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)\\n* Cosmetics (in early stage)\\n* Watches\\n\\nIt is also geographically diversified:\\n\\n* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue\\n* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue\\n* **North America**: 23% of revenue\\n* **Japan**: 8% of revenue\\n* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue\\n\\n**3.0 Historical financial performance**\\n\\nIts revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. \\n\\nKering’s gross margin is stable at \\\\~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.\\n\\nHowever, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.\\n\\n**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**\\n\\nWhen there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.\\n\\nScaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.\\n\\nThe company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.\\n\\n||all numbers in €m|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|\\n|Operating cash flow|€21.541|\\n|Capex|(€7.772)|\\n|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|\\n|Debt|€4.887|\\n|Share buyback|(€2.034)|\\n|Dividends|(€8.229)|\\n|Other|€25|\\n|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|\\n\\nBetween 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated\\xa0**over €21.5 billion**\\xa0in operating cash flow, or\\xa0**a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**\\n\\nClose to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.\\n\\nWhy do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:\\n\\n1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.\\n2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from\\xa0**€7.1 billion**\\xa0in 2019 to\\xa0**€15.4 billion**\\xa0as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \\\\~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4.0 What can be expected?**\\n\\nBased on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:\\n\\n* Organic growth;\\n* Shareholder return; and\\n* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.\\n\\nAll of it, while having a\\xa0**healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**\\n\\nThis is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:\\n\\n1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company\\xa0**with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of\\xa0**acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**\\n2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion**\\xa0in 2019 to\\xa0**€15.4 billion**\\xa0as of June 30th, 2024).\\n3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).\\n\\n**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**\\n\\n  \\n**5.0 Dividends**\\n\\nThe dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \\\\~6%.\\n\\nIf the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.\\n\\n  \\n**6.0 High employee turnover**\\n\\nAt the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were\\xa0**13,403**\\xa0new hires, and\\xa0**11,275**\\xa0employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.\\n\\nThis sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.\\n\\nIn theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).\\n\\nIn addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.\\n\\nGiven the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.\\n\\n  \\n**7.0 The concerns**\\n\\n**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**\\n\\nBack in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.\\n\\nThis brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.\\n\\nIn addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.\\n\\n**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**\\n\\nIn April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.\\n\\nAn investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.\\n\\nThe investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.\\n\\n  \\n**8.0 Valuation** \\n\\nThis is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:\\n\\n* **Revenue**\\xa0\\\\- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \\\\~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.\\n* **Operating margin**\\xa0\\\\- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.\\n\\nBased on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \\\\~9%), the fair value of the company is\\xa0**€27 billion (€220/share)**\\xa0which is very close to the current price of\\xa0**€224/share**.\\n\\nThis offers an IRR of \\\\~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.\\n\\n  \\n**8.1 The Bull Case**\\n\\nThose who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:\\n\\n* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;\\n* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;\\n* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;\\n* Positive macro tailwinds;\\n\\n* Utilizing pricing power;\\n* Integration of recent acquisitions;\\n* Reducing operating costs;\\n\\n**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**\\n\\n\\n\\n**8.2 The Bear Case**\\n\\nThose who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:\\n\\n* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;\\n* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;\\n* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;\\n* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;\\n* Negative macro tailwinds;\\n* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;\\n* Supply chain issues;\\n* Competitive pressure;\\n* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities\\n\\n**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**\\n\\n\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.'}\n",

This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.\\n\\nThe DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.\\n\\nRivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.\\n\\n\"This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,\" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. \"This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability.
