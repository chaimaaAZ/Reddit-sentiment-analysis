Just have a screen on every device the first time you turn on that asks your preferred search engine from a random list.

That is the obvious resolution.  Not Google giving up Chrome which is just stupid.

I think they do not want to do this because it would really hurt Apple.

BTW, I personally do NOT believe Google has a monopoly.  They won the space by providing a superior product.

On every single machine I use Google I could use Bing.  I just do not because Bing is pretty bad compared to Google.  Specially for anything that just recently happened.  Like your Fantasy Basketball player just got hurt.  Google will have in minutes and Bing it will take hours.",3,"apple, microsoft"

Government contracts move slow, they don't usually go with the best product but the lower (not always lowest) bidder in the contract, and the awardee typically does more work than necessary to fulfill their scope. It's not a catalyst. INTC has been losing business for years now, and unless they innovate and get in bigger contracts with major companies they're going to sell off at some point.

Terrible sales and lower than expected return are a telltale sign that they are barely treading water at this point. If you put $1,000 in 5 years ago it would be worth 60% less today. EPS has continually dropped. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 8.9%, meaning it lit $8.88 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue. Any catalyst within the stock is already priced in.

Intel is laying off employees. That, is not a growth strategy, that is a death knell. 

Intel needs to innovate, and you don't innovate when you are letting your innovators go. And don't think that they are cutting their low performing engineers, the management doesn't get a choice in who goes -- they will be the expensive ones -- the ones with decades of experience.

Also, when you are cutting people, people leave -- ""why would I stay here if it is a dying company, I can go to Y and they are doing just fine"".

But one thing I constantly see people get wrong is the fact that Intel fumbled their foundry ball, which made AMD appear to be quite far ahead thanks to TSMC foundries pulling ahead of Intel for certain generations. People at least need to learn how to separate the foundry side and the design side in other words, which I count as basic understanding.

People also need to realize that a quite big portion of their income is not from the consumer market, which means things like leaps on power efficiency might have a better effect on earnings than making the best gaming CPU.

Sure, it helps to be a engineer that understand the underlying shit. But in businesses where we get as accurate benchmarks as we do in this one becomes fairly easy to understand just because of that fact.",5,intel

Your trading app hopefully provides information on stocks you are interested in. You can use P/E ratios and charts to get a general idea. Then there’s looking into revenue year over year to see how it has been performing plus what businesses the company is currently dealing in. Looking at debt. All those small factors.

Then there’s having intuition about a stock’s position relative to the market and what they deal in. Example, we all know AI is the hottest boom right now. Outside of the major FAANG companies I wanted to find something secondary to these companies that flew under the radar. I found Vertiv, partly because I see their equipment, and I realized they’re being used everywhere, so I bought them last May. It has paid off. Then I take potential into account. I sat on buying RDDT themselves forever. Realizing that they’re driving more user engagement and having ties to Google, plus other social media companies losing user bases, I took a small (very small) position out of hope to see what happens. 

Outside of all that, I look at what the biggest ETFs hold. FAANG companies are at the top so it’s smart to mirror them in a way while also finding those rare opportunities in companies after reading articles about the business. The problem is some people follow the advice of Reddit, or a random YouTuber who got lucky with a one random stock, without trying to understand a business. I just heard about WOLF for the first time last week after they made the top gainers list one day.since then I’ve seen 5-10 people post about it, talking about how great the business is. That’s a red flag for me. These same people saw the same $6-$7 stock, probably read some comments, and now want to see it balloon to $20-$30 for a quick profit. They have no long-term plan. They just want to turn their $2K into $6K in a couple weeks to make a quick profit. So don’t follow trends. Follow stability and growth in a business that doesn’t have shady practices. Don’t chase a stock because it’s “cheap”. Invest in companies that make sense to you; not because you believe they’ll double in a short span of time.",4,intel

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,186,1h1kqio,86,2024-11-28 01:38:14,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.

It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.

In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

You can't buy perpetual licenses anymore, only subscription, and they keep hiking the prices. It doesn't even save money anymore, the main problem is the amount of money it would cost to migrate to another platform because Microsoft intentionally makes it difficult to get data out of their platform.

It's kind of like a property owner hiking rent well above market, because they know it will cost their tenants more to move than to just pay the increased rate.

Oracle is the same way. Lots of SaaS companies that seem cheap and great early on, but as they develop a captive customer base, jack up the prices and just exploit their dominant position.",40,microsoft

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.

Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,186,1h1kqio,86,2024-11-28 01:38:14,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.

The tools I've seen on the business end are basic at best and there are multiple SaaS options that do it better.

What exactly does Microsoft have a monopoly in? Seriously.

The only sector Microsoft does better than anyone is Azure which is IaaS. Do we believe a smaller company would do it better after one bad push shut down a bunch of companies this year?

They also provide grants and sponserships for businesses who make products that are, at a basic level, the same as their own.

Those aside, Microsoft doesn't raise their prices. Windows XP in 2001 was 199.99. Before consumers used the internet as much as today.

Windows 11 is 139.99 for a consumer home product. 199.99 for Pro. For a unregistered business, you can get a Business Premium License $22 per user, which includes security, windows 11 pro, and a ton of other products.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

Their advantage is a broker network effect. User installs and a fleet of drivers.

Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

His latest attention seeking event, the kind where he typically lies and exaggerates, his update was that robo taxi is 3 years away.  That tells us that it is certainly more than 3 years away.

Uber recently shifted to pure profit mode.  They have diversification and market dominance and operational superiority.  There’s a lot of money that can be made even in “just” three years.  Especially with contrarian Musk-source headlines providing constant pull backs to reload in between strong ERs.

Also, think through how sadly cheap human drivers actually are.  

The whole premise of Tesla robo taxi hype is the dream of replacing the cheapest and most replaceable component?  Is that really so exciting?

Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more.

I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them.

Tesla sells all cars since 2019? (Might be off on the year) with self driving tech.

So the customer has been paying for it, they make an app with self driving and all the Tesla owners can set their car to self driving and off it goes. Tesla takes a piece for connecting and the car owner gets a piece for allowing the use of the car.

Uber would need to either buy teslas, get customers to list Tesla’s or find another company that gets approval. Say it’s waymo, how many waymo self-driving cars are there vs Tesla. It’s basically 0 on a relative basis. Also if Waymo gets approval, who is to say they don’t want to build their own app?",1,Uber

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

I look at it the same way I see google.

When you dominate 90% of a market and there is a significant tech change (chatGPT/LLMs) what are the odds you maintain 90% on the other side of the technology change?

Uber now controls 60-80% of taxi business. From here to full, full self driving acceptance, what are the odds they keep that or increase it?

Maybe they don’t need to. With plummeting costs to transport, we will likely transport more things. Maybe Uber has 20% of a 10x larger market and ends up with more revenue and profits. Not sure, but it’s kept me out",1,Uber

Valuations rely heavily on future prospects, which means how players are positioned in growth markets.  Why is Intel's outlook poor?

* Intel's bread-and-butter is the x86 market.  x86 is currently a negative growth market, and that's unlikely to change.  They will squeeze a ton of revenue out of x86 for many years, but it's ultimately stagnant at *best*.

* Intel has been trying to diversify into the discrete GPU market.  Unfortunately, it just leaked yesterday that their new B770 die hasn't even taped out yet, and both performance and thermals are way below expectations.  It may never see the light of day, which means Intel will have no serious discrete GPU offering this generation.

* Both AMD and NVDA are burning the midnight oil to release their Windows-on-ARM APU's by Xmas 2025.  More WoA is bad for Intel, not just for CPU sales, but for x86 licensing fees.  No one knows yet if WoA will impact x86 sales seriously, but it's a real possibility for the 24-36 month horizon.

* The one thing Intel has *really* done right lately - Lunar Lake - is being changed significantly in the next gen.

If asking nicely didn't work we have to try a stronger approach aka tariffs.

This question of tariffs here is not to get money but rather to change industry behavior in a way that benefits national security.

At TSMC and Samsung foundries overseas there are dormitories full of young skilled workers that live, breathe, eat, sleep at the Fab. This is a model that simply isn't workable domestically. Advanced node logic manufacturing is incredibly grueling and time intensiv. Case in point is Globalfoundries and its inability to execute 7nm. And before it comes up, Micron is not a fair comparison point as memory fab is a different beast from logic fab.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says",696,1gzx5tr,291,2024-11-25 23:20:54,"Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

It could make sense, but it depends on what's the goal of the credit is and what people really want. Do you want more EVs sold and to maximally help combat climate change, or do you want more EV competition in the marketplace?

As someone that doesn't particularly like Tesla or Musk, the policy change rubs me the wrong way. Presumably the goal of the credit was originally put in place to combat climate change and get more EVs on the road. It feels like they're tweaking the policy away from its original goal into a different goal, solely because Musk is a dick.

Since all cars sold in California and the EU have to be EVs by 2035 anyways, I imagine most manufacturers are already working on this pretty hard. I imagine they'll be a decent amount of competition with or without this new California tax credit to stimulate EV competition.",6,tesla

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Regulatory credits are not subsidies. The idea here is to encourage vehicle manufacturers (and other industries) to reduce carbon emissions by producing more efficient vehicles and transition to Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEV) in the future. Each company is granted an allowance based on some defined regulatory criteria. Since Tesla only makes ZEV's, they have a net credit. Other companies, like Stelantis, that hasn't done much of anything to reduce emissions, can purchase these credits from Tesla to offset their excess.

This is a consequence of companies being slow to adopt cleaner carbon emissions policy. Can't really blame this on Tesla.

2. Tesla already has the largest network of superchargers. Funds for EV charging network expansion are awarded to each state that applies for a grant to support an expansion project. Contracts are awarded to companies that bid for the right to work on the project. This is not exclusive to Tesla.

Tesla has received $28.8 million in funding for 69 sites as part of the NEVI plan. 

3. Most states give tax breaks to companies that setup large scale manufacturing operations, often bringing with them tens of 1000's of jobs. This is done in practically every sector. Intel is expected to receive $5 billion in federal funding to build chips. I understand why that's important, but why does Intel reap all the benefit?

When Tesla was first ramping up, they did get a low interest loan for $485 million to build a factory under an ATVM program. Ford got over $5 billion! Tesla paid the loan off in 2013 (9 years early) while Ford has repaid nothing. Also around that time, GM got a $50 billion bailout while Stelantis received  about $18 billion.
Does the state of Texas give tax breaks to any other companies that decide to move large scale manufacturing operations there?",-1,tesla

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says",696,1gzx5tr,291,2024-11-25 23:20:54,"Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

They come in many forms.  The government created a program to encourage a behavior, in this program it also discourages another behavior.  It is a government incentive (subsidy) to produce electric cars.  The credits are handed out by the government, and they let the market decide how much it is worth.   Therefore, the government is indirectly paying companies to produce electric cars by mandating a quota against ICE vehicles sold.    This effectively subsidizes the price of an electric vehicle.  It’s actually a beautiful subsidy from an economics perspective because of the “free market” aspect - companies can decide the balance of ICE vs EV, and pay for their externalities by purchasing credits from others.  If all companies decide to meet the regulation on their own, the subsidy is effectively worth zero because the goal has been met.  

If the government taxed emissions and used that tax money to distribute it to EV manufacturers, you would consider that a subsidy.  In emissions trading, companies opt to buy credits in lieu of fines from manufacturers with surplus. The money is changing hands still, the behavior is still be incentivized, it is just the market deciding the price.  Regardless, they are both government regulations in an attempt to price a negative externality and incentivize (subsidize) a behavior. 

2. I don’t see how that matters if it is a subsidy or not, the government is subsidizing EV infrastructure.  Everything you said could apply to oil or farm subsidies. 

3.  Still a subsidy. I don’t see the intel CEO saying they should repeal the Chips act. 

No one is saying the government doesn’t hand out subsidies, or that only Tesla gets subsidies from the government.  Subsidies are a crucial tool that the government has to encourage behavior, usually for the good of the country / economy.  I actually think they should exist.  What I don’t think should be happening is someone taking advantage of those subsidies, then turning their back on them, especially if they claim they are building EVs to solve climate change.   We should be subsidizing this behavior and we should be regulating carbon emissions. 

Elon doesn’t think so, yet he continues to hold his hand out and pay for lobbyists to keep the money flowing.",4,tesla

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Size-asymmetric competition stifles innovation so when you are rapidly trying to grow an industry to compete from a global standpoint it opens up the potential of being left in the dust by foreign producers. 

This makes this type of legislation unnecessary in a lot of the industries you mentioned especially the ICE Industry because it’s already established and can only see very minimal improvements compared to EVs which is a rapidly growing and very strategic market. 

China and other countries are focusing a lot on EV development so if we allow for these inefficiencies in the domestic market the US is going to lose a lot of the global market share and eventually the domestic market demands will be met by foreign producers because Tesla can afford to only be making minimal changes and still maintain advantage over companies with smaller sales volume in the short term. This is why musk wants to end all EV subsidies because without them the market isn’t as competitive and they don’t have to spend or focus as much on innovation and can basically just coast along. 

Meanwhile foreign companies are pouring hundreds of billions into R&D that will create a lot of advantages for them in the long term and If foreign companies are able to win this race in the EV market then the US misses out on a lot of job creation and also becomes more reliant on a foreign economy which usually isn’t as big a deal as people make it in other industries but in one as strategic as EVs it is important. 

In regards to your question about solar panel support this legislation on EVs isn’t supporting the corporations through subsidies but rather giving subsidies to the consumers who then create a more balanced and competitive market because smaller companies become more appealing. 

In solar and other green energy development the support is much more complex and we actually do provide credits directly to the producers and manufacturers for R&D costs in addition to consumer based subsidies that incentives spending on the products. 

Tesla actually does qualify for the ITC which is a lot like the one being proposed for EVs they just don’t qualify for other subsidies because they aren’t a manufacturer or developer on a lot of these products and rather is a middleman on clean energy so they don’t qualify for as much because they can’t impact the market nearly much as a middleman compared to the actual individuals on the ends of the transactions like the producers and consumers . 

If they decided to switch to an actual manufacturer and producer of more of the product they offer then they would qualify for much more of these subsidies.",4,tesla

You could definitely argue it would be more beneficial to instead of specific credits and a cutoff when the company has sales volume above a certain point that the credit is no longer given to the consumer it would be more beneficial to just have the consumer credit amount float with the volume of sales a company sees so that the there’s credits to consumers across the board but more so on companies with smaller sales volume to more effectively deal with both issues at once but this is definitely easier.",3,tesla

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Size-asymmetric competition stifles innovation so when you are rapidly trying to grow an industry to compete from a global standpoint it opens up the potential of being left in the dust by foreign producers.

This is an interesting statement considering that all the US auto makers in question source all of their EV tech (Battery, drive units) from outside of the US and have never even made an attempt to develop their own batteries.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Yes EV manufacturers and ICE manufacturers do source their parts from other economies but the actual final assembly portion is very beneficial 
 and provides a lot of jobs and benefits to the US economy through these jobs as well as tax revenue. if foreign car companies see more volume in EV sales then we are set to lose out on these benefits. 

Like I said before the actual company doesn’t receive the subsidies the consumer does. The benefits to the corporation is in the form of being able to more efficiently compete in the market. 

That being said even though they don’t directly receive the subsidies they do allow for smaller corporations to take different strategies like make improvements on receiving from better producers. When you have size-asymmetrical competition this doesn’t happen because the small companies typically have to focus solely on being a cheaper option to gain market share and can’t try and focus on higher quality unless they have extremely large amounts of money to use for start up costs. 

Yes tesla is one of the largest manufacturers of energy storage and is building a lot of facilities but they already receive supply side subsidies on this portion of energy based operation and doesn’t have anything to do with what you said in your comment before you changed it to remove that portion. 

your original point was about solar panels not the energy storage and on solar panels they are not a manufacturer or producer in the typical sense and act more akin to a middleman.",4,tesla

I think that getting in at this price is quite risky overall. There’s nothing to stop it from falling down again. I think I’d like to see this stock confidently cross $10 per share, and stay there before investing if you want to play it safe.

Also, I just don’t think air taxis are going to be a very profitable market, if it even works at all. I think their primary market will be selling aircraft to those interested. Another limiting factor is that these craft will require a completely different piloting certification. It’s a new type of propulsion, and it’s vtol, transitioning to flying like a plane. The current pilots licenses don’t cover that kind of thing, which means either a new type of license, or a certification that you would need to attain after your fixed wing license.

Another major factor is how these would manage in bad weather, and poor visibility. They’re small craft, and are going to get blown around in high winds. I’m really curious what the wind limit for operation of these aircraft will be. Also, our weather systems are becoming more destabilized as climate change progresses.",10,tesla

But now the grinding diminishing returns chart kicks in. If Amazon's new upcoming chip even moderately impresses, that is direct hole in NVIDIA earnings. Same for Microsoft. Tesla will stick to NVDA. So data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in, say 2026 or 2027. As next gen chips sales drop, market saturation kicks in to level growth. So I saw it easy to forecast 15 to 145, but 145 to 200 or 145 to 500 seems exponentially riskier to assume as a medium term target. Take Amazon. If Amazon is happy with whatever chips it proposes (even if nowhere near Blackwell levels), that drop in sales would hurt NVIDIA (or just the news). Unless other AI consumers ping Amazon for its chips, they may very well replace Amazon as a NVIDIA client. On the other hand, should NVDA drop to 120s, the P/E becomes a too good to be true, a steal. Either or I remain long on NVDA but I no longer expect the terrific growth story I once had with Tesla in 2020 or NVDA to date.",2,nvidia

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the third quarter ended October 27, 2024, of $35.1 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter and up 94% from a year ago.

For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.78, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.81, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago.

“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.

“AI is transforming every industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure,” he said.

NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 27, 2024, to all shareholders of record on December 5, 2024.",lygdth8,"The world only needs so many GPUs, but also:

- Several players working to compete with NVIDIA in this space (AMD, Intel, Amazon, et al)

- Companies don’t generally upgrade their hardware whenever something new comes out- AWS and Azure still use Intel CPUs that came out ~7 years ago.

- AI itself is overhyped (like everything before it), and most companies buying Nvidia GPUs to fuck around with AI will end up learning it was a waste of their time and money and won’t be buying Blackwell and beyond (what’s more, those GPUs will probably hit the secondary market).

I train models for a living on two RTX 3090 GPUs connected via NVLink. I bought them about a year ago. ~$700 each, used. I realize companies don’t mind paying $5,000 per-GPU, but main point is you don’t need the latest and greatest and you don’t need a lot of them to “do AI stuff”.",1,nvidia

AI has been *transformative* in the last ~12 months with communication surveillance systems.  The major providers are lining up to buy as much NVDA hardware as they can get their hands on, in the range of 9 figures each.

Those providers without bleeding-edge AI solutions just produce much shittier real-world results and are not signing new deals.  In this industry, AI *works*, it produces real-world results that give real-world RoI for broker-dealers who upgrade their monitoring packages to AI-enabled ones.  Fewer review staff, fewer false positives, more defensible compliance posture with the regulatory bodies, and reduced risk of fines for not meeting monitoring requirements.  Those fines can be dozens to hundreds of millions for failure to monitor regulated employees sufficiently, and they are handed out on the regular.

Financial communication monitoring like this is just one of the many, many industries people don't even know exists, and it's pumping money into Nvidia's pockets as fast as Jensen can produce chips for them.  Just in this market sector, there are other groups of providers pouring money into AI to monitor retail transactions directly for AML and sanctions violations.  Yet another group of companies are gobbling up AI for their direct trade surveillance offerings.

There you have 3 entire segments of industry that few laypeople have even heard of, all of which are spending hand over fist on NVDA's chips, and all of whom have positive RoI on that investment because it's just so damn good at what it does.

So yes, the dude above you is 100% right that the ""AI"" running on your computer is just the left over jokes and toys of what's happening with the real heavy lifting at the industrial level.",21,nvidia

I mentioned times I found price movement “odd” and looking back it was probably, at least in part due to that. 

Also, this clears up something i’ve been confused about for a while. I understand that some people take profits around earnings, but I wondered why stocks that the market seemed to like, crushed estimates, and provided good guidance, dropped after earnings.

Autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off. When that happens, Uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but that's fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own. Uber can also clean/fix self driving cars, but that (which would require stations scattered all around) is a whole other business vs an asset light app.  Some talk that Uber was interested in EXPE and perhaps it tries to diversify (travel super app.)

So I think somewhere in the middle. I don't think Uber goes away by any means, but I can see Uber looking different/very different 5-10 years from now. Self-driving on a massive scale is still a long ways off, but I do think that it'll probably continue to be a cloud over Uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 5-10+ years from now.

In the short and medium term it is a financial powerhouse, having turned corner and hitting straightaways on revenues and margins.  They’ve broken away from the pack like Lyft and everyone else.  They have diversification.  They are international.  Taxi is fading away, Uber is the verb for all ride sharing, and increasingly, food delivery.

Transportation from A to B isn’t a fad that ebbs and wanes, and Uber is entrenched.

Their last two ERs gave visibility into this power, yet other more random and transient factors have driven the recent sell off.

The perceived long term threat was from Tesla, but the many-times-delayed emperor’s fashion show that finally happened last month made it clear that Uber has several years of safety from that.

I see many posts here worried about a futuristic world that’s years away.  Two things: One, a lot of money gets made waiting for the future to arrive.  Two, big rich incumbents tend to find ways of owning future developments that come along.

On that same front, Waymo is so clearly many years ahead of Tesla, and Uber is already partnered with Uber.

Should the landscape and competitive environment truly change, there will time and opportunities to bail in and out as new information indicates.


You have to pass through the near future to get to the wildly distant future.  Uber stock got thrashed on the vaguest rumor of an EXPE travel merger, presumably because their exec used to work there.  But it never happened and yet the stock price hasn’t reset.  I think before we have flying cars and whatever else, Uber could do things that are more attainable and boring, but profitable.  Instead of flying cars, they could invade the logistics space.  It’s a good fit, and they have the scale to take share and margin.

Having recently taken my first my Waymo I am struggling to see where Uber fits into this. Using the Waymo app was almost identical to the Uber one.

Autonomous at scale is a long way off but taking one from PHX to the hotel and back it was pretty easy to see a future where dense urban cores (and maybe suburbs too) are dominated by autonomous ridehailing vehicles...

So I’d guess this partnership remains the way it is now, it’s still a win win for both. Waymo gets to test their tech and not worry about marketing and attracting customers. Uber gets more profit. I don’t think it ever was a partnership where one can’t live without the other",3,Uber

The reason too that Meta copied the others is because they wanted to capture growth in the business. You create a competitor like threads when the competition angers their base. Another is Reels which is a copy of the fastest growing social Internet which is TicTok. They won't copy Reddit because it isn't growing and they haven't made any angey people to capture. Reddit was lucky with banning and angering racists and bigots back in 2017 which actually lead to Voat to be rude with those types ans eeddit just haa angry political tribalism.,1,meta

Secondly, it's not like Reddit was not popular or didn't exist prior to the whole new google algo change... This sub, r/investing and r/wallstreetbets  has combined tens of MILLIONS of users...

Amazon announced it was entering the hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatment markets through its newly expanded pay-per-visit telehealth service, Amazon One Medical.

Not only you, but I also can't find any well-grounded reason on how HIMS would be able to competes against a behemoth like AMZN or any other med giants. Best I can bring up would be some lame excuses you probs seen somewhere already. the answer could be brand perception, compounded medication or just that the telehealth market has enough TAM for multiple players, in the end it's just an open-ended question that opens for argument, like how Spotify gonna competes against YouTube Music/Apple Music, it's a billion dollar question that no one has right or wrong answer.

But you do realize that HIMS always had giants like AMZN as competitors since entire of its history right?  
Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, AMZN, TDOC or whatever.  
Yet, HIMS still grows revenue like 70% YoY and subscribers like 40% YoY every year for the past few years despite these competitive concerns, and despite being pressured by giants everywhere.

Yet, HIMS will doing CY2025 EBITDA at $250M, that's like CY2025 EV/EBITDA multiples of just 16, while growing revenue at 70% YoY. For a quick comparison, GOOG will also be trading at roughly the same CY2025 EV/EBITDA as HIMS.

Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,9,1grrx4w,51,2024-11-15 08:32:29,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills

* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

20A was a one-product premature version of 18A, it's a very bad look they canceled this. If we can believe their take that this was due to refocus on 18A because that is going so well, then maybe it turns out fine. If they simply couldn't make it work well, then not so much.

Every step needs to be extremely well controlled and understood.

TSMC has very advanced and successful analysis systems that have helped them really understanding how each critial step is doing and whether/ what they need to slightly tweak to adjust for fluctuations upstream.


Samsung has had issues with not being able to find where the real issues are in the process, struggling to find a good sweet spot to begin with.


Intel has had process issues, but also design issues where they went for an architecture that relied on some process steps to be really good...and they weren't and could not be fixed without open heart surgery.

Just keep going with development, and you'll end up at another of those opportunities, and you'd call that a next generation. There are some real revolutions in design, those a more binary jumps, like bspdn and gaa.

The Downside is that you don't monetize, and don't learn any new insights from indistrializing the process. But if you can eat the cost then it can pay off.",3,intel

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

good point and imagine, a new player had to start a fab, from scratch. they would have to build of everything. intel in contrast has everything, except the fabs, and building those is hard enough but at least they are doing it now, you could now say what's with samsung, tbh idk why their fabs are so behind

\> Why is TSMC the only choice now then?

idk, maybe bc a fab is so complex and running these ASML machines are hard to operate, a bit like McDonalds soft serve machines; probably because TSMC doubled-down on ASML very early and ordered max amount of EUV machines",2,intel
Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,9,1grrx4w,51,2024-11-15 08:32:29,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?
