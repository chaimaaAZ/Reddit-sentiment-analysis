They filed for bankruptcy back in mid July. I‚Äôm here to tell you why Sunnova is next. \nI‚Äôve worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years. Sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealers/installers all year. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sunnova is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. Search Reddit/facebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and it‚Äôs a pretty open secret. \n\n‚ÄúNOVA holds approximately $7.98 billion in total debt. This represents a 25.33% increase over the past year, contributing to a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.58, which is significantly above industry norms‚Äù\n\nThey currently sit at a $485 million market cap, eerily similar to Sunpower before they went under. It is only a matter of time for Sunnova. Most dealers/installers are moving all of their volume away from using them as they‚Äôve been late on payments. Instead of the reps getting paid upon install, they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated. Sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing. The last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new Sunnova PPAs/loans. \n\nSunnova holds an INSANE amount of debt. I honestly have no idea how they are still afloat. I didn‚Äôt think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year. Their free cash flow is in the toilet.\n\n‚ÄúSunnova Energy International (NOVA) reported a negative free cash flow (FCF) of approximately -$2.13 billion over the trailing 12 months. This figure is derived from an operating cash flow of -$282.75 million and capital expenditures totaling -$1.85 billion. The significant cash burn highlights the company‚Äôs capital-intensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations‚Äù\n\nI know what you‚Äôre thinking, their stock is already down massively since the election. Yes, that was based on all solar stocks dropping. Sunrun (which I believe will be around for the long haul) also dropped like a rock. However I believe within 6 months Sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0. \nI don‚Äôt think trump will kill the solar tax credit. However it wont matter for Sunnova. Their CEO is a former Enron exec. This company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat. Has worked for far longer than it should have. Their partnership with Home Depot has largely been a dud. Nothing like Sunruns partnership with Costco. \n\nUnless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1% in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts. \n\nPOSITIONS:\nNOVA 1/17/25 $2.5 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $1 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $2 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $3 PUT', 'Is it smart to dump 10k into VOO at these levels?

Calls typically have a certain amount of delta (stock representation more or less; 1 delta = 1 stock. -1 delta = shorting 1 stock)\n\n2. Say the arbitrage fund buys a 50-delta call from MSTR, essentially representing 50 shares of the company\n\n3. They now need to balance this out by short selling 50 shares of MSTR, which equates to -50 delta. 50-50=0, theoretically owning 0 stock. Hence, delta ‚Äúhedge‚Äù, protecting itself against losses from price fluctuations.\n\n4. However, calls, unlike shares, can *change* in delta. Recall high school physics, delta is velocity and gamma is acceleration. If the stock price rises, delta rises (accelerates) and the opposite for a drop in price. So, that would be part of the underlying profit, where if prices rise astronomically, they would gain more from their calls than lose from their short* -> Hence, market neutral ‚Äúgamma‚Äù traders.\n\n*the fund would have to short sell more MSTR shares to get the initial 0 delta or buy more calls to balance out the drop in call delta to remain delta neutral.\n\n5. Another way for the funds to make profit would be volatility. Volatility calculation is complicated, so just assume it is a premium you pay for a call because you expect large moves in stock price. If more price fluctuations occur, people would expect more volatility and thus pay a bigger premium. \n\n6.

They are moving RAM off-die to save $$ and reduce the cost to market to be more competitive with... you guessed it... ARM APU's.  It's a real gamble.

Regarding the cost though, it is a sliding scale. Your mission that is absolutely impossible to to be econonomically viable at the current $6k-10k/kg launch cost, may very well be viable at $2000.

Of course, the huge qualifier in this case is competing platforms. People are speaking and aggregating in X, TikTok, IG, Discord (?).

There are a few reasonable logics to predict so. \n\n1. Adoption of content-creator payment scheme (for one example, a paid-subreddit system, which the management has announced that they are planning to adopt) will cause far more users to come in to the platform to make money - and we will see much higher rate of interesting contents being posted vs. before. This in turn will attract more users who previously did not use Reddit before, and hence the virtuous cycle.\n\n2. Reddit has only just begun expanding outside of the US. There are of course, many users already in English-speaking countries like the UK and Australia - but Reddit plans to better service countries where the native language is not English through real-time AI translation of Reddit‚Äôs contents. France was the first country to adopt this, and this will expand into 35 countries by year-end. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine seeing a rapid inflow of new global users with this service.\n\n3. Increase in efficiency of advertising (which would allow higher number of ads + higher ad prices), leveraging the huge data base (such as monetizing it for LLM with Google and Open AI), improvement in search functions (pulling in more users to search within Reddit rather than coming in through mostly Google searches at the moment) are all additional points that will bring in additional value to both users and clients.\n\nAt the end of the day, it‚Äôs no brainer that better platform = higher number of users = increase in ad revenue = increase in profit = increase in share price.\n\nLastly - as we have seen with many giant US tech companies in history - companies start adding more and more features & services to its platform to increase both users and revenue stream. Things like Google adding Gmail and Google drive, Facebook adding messenger, etc etc. Reddit has quite a long way to get to that level, but I‚Äôm sure management will think about this as the user base continues to increase over the next few years.\n\nI personally think Reddit has potential to become the next big tech -  this will depend heavily on how the executions are done by the management & Reddit team - but is certainly worth keeping our eyes on.', 'Got in myself just before earnings. The market readjusted but has still failed to capture its value. There‚Äôs still huge upwards potential. So I‚Äôm still holding. Markets really struggle to price Social Media. \n\nGoogle needs Reddit, not the other way around. The internet has become very poor for getting firsthand knowledge on different topics. Just look at how many people will search up xxxxxx - Reddit.\n\nEven if reddit were dropped from the algorithm, the shift has staying power. Reddit has many more users now and many more app downloads. In fact Reddit could probably work on its own search function (I often use google to find some topics on reddit) \n\nThere‚Äôs also the continued growth in data use for AI purposes (I‚Äôm dubious that this will be more than the modest money earner that it is now - but is possible; it is a massive and growing source of written language on many different topics). \n\nAdvertising is growing and is huge, its ability to target advertising beats out any other social media website. Where else do people follow, read and give so much information on their favourite products, services, hobbies etc. \n\nIt‚Äôs userbase is much more income rich than relatively more pricey social media sites (X and especially Snapchat).

Tariffs are not necessarily inflationary! Might I remind you of the Smoot Hawley tariffs that were promptly followed by one of the most deflationary periods in US history. \n\nThe last point is a joke, but I mean the first 4. In general, a bunch of really wild policy proposals are going to get tossed out to the media the next 4 years. Over-react to them for political purposes all you want, but if you try to make market moves off of them, you're probably going to get burnt. Tariffs are one example.

Or reading and maybe they have a point? Too many people acting like investing is politics and they don\'t want to hear anything that doesn\'t match their opinion.  Heaven forbid someone is short a popular growth long. Look at Reddit - tons of echo chamber stock specific subreddits that didn\'t exist before. The quality of discussion has gone down - used to be a great place for balanced discussions. Now people just want everyone to agree with the prevailing trends and that the hot stocks will continue to ""only go up.""\n\nMaybe a short report is right, maybe it\'s wrong but part of it makes you see the stock in a different way and you get some takeaway from someone else\'s differing opinion.  Maybe they\'re wrong in general and you simply thank them and buy more. But this instant jump to ""MANIPULLATTIONNN"" is such a waste of time imo, it doesn\'t do anything. \n\nAlso, if the company is that fantastic  then nobody has anything to worry about and at $20 a share still it\'s not ""destroyed""/$0.\n\n"" Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).""\n\nClass actions happen any time a stock is down materially for anything. It\'s not material. \n\n""Shares drop this week again.""\n\nThe stock has a week where it doesn\'t go up? Again if you think it\'s so great then you should be thankful for the continued opportunity to buy more.', 'Stocks are usually shorted for good reason its not smart to bet against them unless a thorough fundamental analysis shows otherwise. History is full of apes trying to long heavily shorted stocks and losing their shirt. Checkout $SAVA or $FFIE for example.\n\nGo through the short report and cleary try to refute every single point and report back. We can then discuss if the short has merit or they gifted you with a big buying opportunity.', 'institutional ownership also increased significantly in the last couple of days plus every stock culpers did a hit piece on bounced back and performed really well afterwards', 'But your opinion is appreciated much and you do have some valid points.', 'I do not understand what is wrong with asking for opinions and what other people think for rddt and zeta? I am not ashamed of seeking other peoples points of view so I broaden my knowledge. \n\nI don‚Äôt yell I ask if my opinion is valid or am I missing something and I wanted a discussion to get consensus on what is more probable.\n\nIn general there is more evidence things are being manipulated than not according to my current research. But I am open to be swayed with facts.\n\nYou just attack instead of being constructive, no one claimed anything, take some time to read the post. I just put how I see it and ask if anyone else see the same or opposite.', 'There\'s nothing wrong with the above and asking questions. Asking questions is a good thing and I didn\'t mean to be harsh above.\n\nIt\'s more a general concern that I\'ve seen over the last 4-5 years with more and more attempts to assign blame anytime a stock stops going up. Or having a stock not go up every day/week lead to posts I see on here all the time like the other day where someone asked ""why is NVDA down so much!!??!"" It was down 4% after being up 182% YTD. The amount of people who complained every time Google was down on here over the last year often seemed countless - you\'d think the stock was down YTD but it was up double digit %. In the 10 years I\'ve been on here I\'ve never seen posts like I have in the last 4 years where something is down 1-2-3% and people talk about it ""cratering."" \n\nTalking about ZETA being ""destroyed"" as if it\'s already a 0 or something and (checks) it\'s still up an awfully good 138% YTD.\n\nStocks will go down and sometimes it will take a while for them to turn up again. 2020/21 and now 2023/24 I think have crated unrealistic expectations. \n\nShort reports happen. They are part of investing and people are going to have different opinions and sometimes those people have a bigger soapbox to stand on. \n\nAnd if that\'s the case, then it goes back to the Peter Lynch idea of know what you own. If you don\'t know what you own you can get shaken out of a good name at a good price. If you don\'t know what you own and own something that\'s expensive and overextended (ZETA +337% YTD before the short report) and just keeping thinking it\'s going to go up and up rather than taking profits, it\'s not difficult for someone to come in and make a short case. \n\nIf there is a short report that\'s wrong - and I\'ve taken advantage of a few - then you have to be able to quickly imo make a case why because if it\'s a real opportunity it probably won\'t last that long. I remember buying Trade Desk at $70 years ago on a short report and then it went on to go to $700 and then 10-for-1 split, but that $70 didn\'t last long. Or Spruce\'s Elf short report that said it was run like a sex cult. The stock has come down in recent months but initially was up 75-80% after. But there\'s been times over the years that the shorts were right, I was wrong/missed something or maybe they weren\'t entirely right but they made a good point that changed somewhat how I saw the stock.\n\nToo many people just jump to calling anything short manipulation and hey maybe they got the auditor wrong and that\'s not good, but was there anything in it that was right or changed the way you look at the stock? If not, then buy. But if it\'s manipulation and the stock should rebound, I guess I\'d think you\'d have a case why it\'s a great business and already have been buying the dip. \n\n""And the single most important thing to me in the stock market, for anyone, is to know what you own. I am amazed at how many people own stocks, they would not be able to tell you why they own it. They couldn‚Äôt say in a minute or less why they own it. **Actually, if you really press them down, they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúThe reason I own this is the sucker is going up.‚Äù And that‚Äôs the only reason.** That‚Äôs the only reason they own it. And if you can‚Äôt explain ‚Äì I‚Äôm serious, if you can‚Äôt explain to a 10-year-old in two minutes or less why you own a stock, you shouldn‚Äôt own it. And that‚Äôs true I think of about 80% of people that own stocks.""\n\nToo many people own stocks because ""line is going up"" and imo, in recent years, ""line is going up"" also validates a name in people\'s minds rather than people questioning whether the fundamentals still match up. Ask Cathie Wood - ARKK is a dictionary definition of that - 2020/21 validated her belief in disruptive growth themes and rather than realize that she happened to be at the right investment place at the right time, she bagheld 2020/21\'s biggest crap all the way down. She had realized losses of something like 21B across the Ark funds - absolutely massive realized losses. And yet she still has yet to ever admit ""I was wrong"" or change her approach even slightly.  She even tweeted to her shareholders that the losses were a good thing.  You will be wrong in investing, it\'s a continual learning experience and it\'s dismaying to see people like Cathie Wood obliterate billions and watch as there\'s not one iota of ""I was wrong, I need to look at changing my approach, this didn\'t work, this is what needs to change going forward.""\n\nThat\'s all. Wasn\'t meant to be harsh, but I just think 1) investing in general has gotten too much everyone only wanting to hear similar opinions and shorting is just a fact of investing 2) people\'s investing time frame has shrunk to the point where it seems like if the stock doesn\'t go up for a week, something is wrong and 3) I just think that it\'s important for people to be open to learning from those who have different opinions and not everyone with a different opinion is somehow a villain that\'s easy to blame when a name someone owns goes down.', 'Thanks a lot for taking your time to continue the discussion. \n\nI totally agree today people are impatient and as it is said, trading is a game of patience. \n\nUnfortunately you are also correct that people will think things go only up and then they panic when there is a correction. Also indeed too many do not know what they own because they just buy stocks they see or hear from someone. \n\nBut that gives others, more rational ones the edge. As well as to scammers unfortunately. \n\nGood to know there are still logical ones :) I am new to this game so it is nice knowing still possible to learn something of quality here.', 'I got burned and learned my school this summer the hard way on meme stocks :) Hopefully others will learn from people like you', 'What does it matter if it perceived as harsh or not ?

Therefore, the government is indirectly paying companies to produce electric cars by mandating a quota against ICE vehicles sold.    This effectively subsidizes the price of an electric vehicle.  It‚Äôs actually a beautiful subsidy from an economics perspective because of the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù aspect - companies can decide the balance of ICE vs EV, and pay for their externalities by purchasing credits from others.  If all companies decide to meet the regulation on their own, the subsidy is effectively worth zero because the goal has been met.  \n\nIf the government taxed emissions and used that tax money to distribute it to EV manufacturers, you would consider that a subsidy.  In emissions trading, companies opt to buy credits in lieu of fines from manufacturers with surplus. The money is changing hands still, the behavior is still be incentivized, it is just the market deciding the price.  Regardless, they are both government regulations in an attempt to price a negative externality and incentivize (subsidize) a behavior. \n\n2. I don‚Äôt see how that matters if it is a subsidy or not, the government is subsidizing EV infrastructure.  Everything you said could apply to oil or farm subsidies. \n\n3.  Still a subsidy. I don‚Äôt see the intel CEO saying they should repeal the Chips act. \n\nNo one is saying the government doesn‚Äôt hand out subsidies, or that only Tesla gets subsidies from the government.  Subsidies are a crucial tool that the government has to encourage behavior, usually for the good of the country / economy.  I actually think they should exist.  What I don‚Äôt think should be happening is someone taking advantage of those subsidies, then turning their back on them, especially if they claim they are building EVs to solve climate change.

Does ENPH still has a moat?,Donday90,21,2024-11-26 18:22:52,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,['ENPH'],39,"['Well first thing to know is that Enphase isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsolar panel‚Äù company.  They make and sell all the other pieces that would go into a solar install.\n\nTheir parts are considered top of the line, so if you were doing a commercial job or a nice residential, you‚Äôd use Enphase parts.  I think they work with multiple brands of panel.  \n\nIn a market where solar has slowed down and is probably more price competitive, I‚Äôm guessing buyers and builders would push to use ‚Äúthe good stuff‚Äù since they are in the driver‚Äôs seat right now.  \n\nSo I suppose that would be their moat, being a supplier of quality.\n\nThat said, yes solar sales have been slashed probably by at least half during the interest rate hikes, since people will borrow to fund an install or builders will look for what is optional to cut their bid price.  \n\nThere‚Äôs also an active culture war against anything green, environmental, etc. and that includes performative government programs to pick winners and losers, to make sure green projects are the losers.\n\nHowever I have an opinion that money transcends politics, and that getting free electricity from sunlight is a killer economic application.  Electricity is your one utility bill that is already too high and will never, ever go down.  Saving money on electricity bills is useful to anyone, any business, no matter what their politics may be.  \n\nNot only that but grids and capacity are already broken or breaking.  Adding more generation plants and expecting to transmit electricity cross country hits problems due to our garbage grid and distribution.  Solar is perfect for avoiding those pitfalls.  Solar is generally installed on the building or very near it, so no grid and distribution drama.\n\nAs for rates being higher or lower, that just tweaks the payback period.  Early adopters loved the basically instant payback, but I think once they know that treat is never coming back, they‚Äôll consider solar even if the payback is slower.\n\nThink it through: who doesn‚Äôt want cheaper electric bills?  And does it really matter if the payback is 4 years or 12 years before you‚Äôre on free-electric for life?\n\nFor as much as Wall Street cowboys recognize the next admin hates science and alternative energy, they forget that the shadow president owns a solar and home power storage company, so there‚Äôs probably a limit on how much they‚Äôll actually try to bury it.\n\nIt‚Äôs this longer term thesis that is why I was loading up ENPH in the $50‚Äôs.\n\nI do worry that whatever ENPH makes, China will rip it off and dump-sell it, and something as simple as a family copyright deal could get them an exemption.

Their inverters were failing as a super high rate (close to 50% within a couple of years) costing installers millions to service. As a result, installers simply dropped them and now even warehouses dont even carry their brand. At least not here in CA.\n\nENPH most assuredly has a moat in micro inverters. No one bothers with alternatives in the USA because its not worth it. They are established, reliable and the price is the same as competitors so whats the point to gambling with other brands?\n\nThe problem with ENPH and all micro inverters is they suck with batteries and batteries are getting cheap. So if you want a system with batteries, you generally want to stay away from micros unless you like losing an extra 5-10% of your energy for no reason, and you like paying for 2 extra central inverters for no reason whatsoever than to invert extra times simply due to where the inverters are located along the string. These are two more points of failure and unlike micros, these will be far more expensive.\n\nHowever if you just want solar and grid connect, there is no real competition.

There is still a financial limit but becoming less so as prices drop.\n\nMicro inverters are by far, the easiest to install. Installer love them for that reason, and they generally recommend them over anything else resulting in more sales (even when they are not in the best interest of the customer). To the consumer, they provide an ok improvement in power generation due to panel isolation. This helps on cloudy days or if you have a really crappy roof setup with lots of shadows. If you dont have those problems, then their benefit is very low. But the problem comes at the cost of two extra inversions if you want to use batteries. This is what I describe above.\n\nFor anyone who intends to get batteries the best solution is optimizers plus central inverter AFTER the batteries. Optimizers give you the same isolation as micros but without inversion. So what you want to do is go direct from panels to batteries and then from batteries to inverter. That would be the ideal setup with no dumb loss in power and fewer parts (2 less inverters and less panels needed). SEDG had this advantage but as I stated above, they blew it due to QA problems. So now the only real option is SMA who bought out Tigo, who makes an optimizer. \n\nI would suggest buying SMA but Im not a huge fan of EU from an economic perspective. But if they can become popular in the USA then the sky is the limit. But the problem is as stated. Installers want easy installs and could care less about their customers so they sell Enphase. Interest rates hurt solar/batteries. State laws like those in CA also hurt adoption. Now add the political environment in the USA and uncertainty around it.

If MSTR is up 10% on the day, these two funds together will have to buy 1B of MSTR, which is 1% of the company. Note that most stocks don\'t even have 1% of their shares trade in a day.\n * **(3)** Various short sellers and call sellers have been hurt by certain initial moves, and have had to close, pushing the rally even further. See for example the r/thetagang guy.\n * **(4)** Various hedge funds were short MSTR and long BTC because it was trading at a premium of 1.5x NAV, and that premium kept increasing, causing people to have to close their books at a massive loss.\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, please add any other reasons you can think of below.\n\n\nThe magnitude of the MSTR moves, and the current premium it trades at, are truly an astonishing market phenomenon.', ""At some point, retail buyers will run out of money.

Speculation happens when investors are speculating on future growth in cash flows, if it's a bubble it pops ultimately because the cash flows don't materialise. When a company issues shares, investors are buying them because of the company's ability to generate cash now or in the future. When Microstrategy sells shares, investors get nothing but an asset at 1/3 of its value. Companies are meant to trade above book value because they generate value, MSTR only trades above it because it has a scheme to bring in more investors and increase BTC/share. That's not just a speculative bubble and sounds like a pyramid scheme to me. The exception to what I've described is commodities which don't generate cash but hold some (perceived) value, which is what bitcoin itself is, and meme stocks like GameStop where weird market forces take over. I guess you could argue MSTR is a meme stock and is overvalued just because it's a meme but it's no secret that they're doing what I described."", 'Thanks for the info, the world of finance is a wacky one.', ""I get that argument.  I was talking about the bonds.  I'm not super familiar with the process of convertible bonds.\n\nThe attraction to MSTR is that they are going to issue more zero-coupon bonds, and use that to buy more bitcoin.  So instead of buying 1 bitcoin, you could buy 1-bitcoin worth of shares worth of MSTR.  As you rightly point out, the 1-bitcoin-worth-of-MSTR-shares costs much more (like 3 or 4 times the value of the company's bitcoin). The idea is the 1-bitcoin is always worth the price of 1-bitcoin, whatever it may be.  Meanwhile, MSTR is basically getting free money on the promise of higher stock prices, which they turn into more bitcoin. \n\nSo let's say you buy 1000 shares of MSTR now at $400,000, which is worth 1 bitcoin, or $95,000.  The company is going to increase their holdings of bitcoin by 5-10fold, which means you'll have $480,000 to $950,000 worth of bitcoin in the future.  So your $400,000 worth of MSTR looks cheap by comparison.\n\nI can't believe I'm defending MSTR, but here we are.\n\nSo what's the hole to poke in this argument?  I'd say that MSTR, by issuing this convertible bonds, is diluting their share count.  So if your 1000 shares currently entitle you to 1 bitcoin worth of shares in the company, in the future you might be diluted 2 or 3 times, so your shares are only worth .5 bitcoin or .33 bitcoin.  Now, when they increase their holdings 5-10 fold.... you'll have 5\\*.4 to 10\\*.4 bitcoin, or about 3 bitcoin worth of shares.\n\n3 bitcoin times 95,000 = 285,000, or a MSTR shareprice of $285.\n\nSo MSTR is still severely overvalued.  It's just a way for the company to make money off the backs of its shareholders.  The emperor Saylor has no clothes."", ""Most institutional convertible bond investors short the growing stock delta as it approaches the conversion strike. So at the point it is worth a 1:1 share they have a 1:1 short which cancels out. \n\nSome investors buy the bonds outright but they're small beans compared to big buyers like [Allianz](https://x.com/BTC_Archive/status/1859916863750439041)."", 'Ah, man, I remember my first time investing. You are parroting what the media says about the markets, but none of that is true. Mechanically, what makes a stock trade at a ""fair"" value based on cash flows? It\'s supply and demand. When a stock is fundamentally overvalued, traders might see that and sell their position (or even short it). And as there are more people trying to sell at the current ask than there are buyers, the ask will creep downward until there is something close to equilibrium. Of course, that ignores the fact that a market maker can put their thumb on the scale, but mechanically, that\'s the idea. \n\nIf millions of people flip their 401k to auto-invest on broad indexes like the S&P 500, do you think that every 2 weeks they are checking to make sure that APPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, etc. are all at an ""appropriate"" value based on cash flows? Of course not. So that right there shows how there can be a huge demand for tickers with zero regard for fundamental analysis.\n\n""Meme Stock"" is a nonsense term meant to degrade the sentiment (and ultimately value) of stocks that large institutions have short positions on. Their crazy volatility is almost never due to actual ""crazed"" retail sentiment alone - and in reality, it\'s completely undefined. Was Tootsie Roll a meme stock? It had huge amounts of short interest and moved along with gamestop and other ""memes"" during their runups, and was written about as a meme in several articles like [this one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/01/27/not-just-gamestop-here-are-the-meme-stocks-wallstreetbets-traders-are-pumping-up-during-this-extremely-erratic-reddit-rally/).  Meanwhile they are profitable quarter after quarter and have a healthy balance sheet - was it really ""crazed redditors"" that caused them to spike in cycles just like the other memes? Did you personally see a lot of Tootsie Roll memes and posts on reddit?\n\nMy point is this; cash flow is one factor in determining a stocks value, but it is not the only one and to pretend that there is some calculation you can do to get the ""proper"" value of a stock would mean that sentiment, future prospects, and market mechanics in general play no role. It\'s a silly stance, quite frankly.', ""I tried a back-of-the-envelope breakdown of the future worth of MSTR, a few comments down.  I think the key to what makes this pyramid-like is where they're getting their money.  When they issue convertible bonds, they're promising to dilute their shares in the future.  If they dilute 50%, and increase their bitcoin holdings 2 or even 3 times, you are still down, underwater, in NAV.\n\nThere is no free money, so either they have to promise future dilution to get their money, or they have to take out loans and take-on debt (which is risky and can get expensive).\n\nThe only good argument I can see here is if you think it is a good idea \\*to take out a loan to buy bitcoin\\*.  If that is something you would like to do, then a large company can get a loan at a better rate than you can.

If MicroStrategy ceased trading, all you\'d own is 1/3 of the bitcoin you paid for. The entire model of MSTR relies on future share issuance to fund purchases of bitcoin and that is pyramidal in nature.

If you bought the dips, how do you even know that's the bottom of the dip? And if you didn't buy the dips, how do you even know if that really is the bottom of the dip? \n\nSo people DCA. Time in market beats timing the market"", 'This is an interesting observation! While buying the dips is an intuitive strategy (and can work under certain circumstances), its underperformance in your analysis can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n\n---\n\n1. Opportunity Cost and Market Timing Challenges\n\nDips Might Be Shallow or Short-lived: The S&P 500 has generally trended upward over the past 10 years, with relatively shallow drawdowns and quick recoveries. Waiting for a 5%, 10%, or 15% drop before adding funds can leave cash sidelined for long periods, reducing overall returns compared to consistent DCA.\n\nMissed Compounding Opportunities: If you are waiting to buy dips, some of your cash remains uninvested during market rallies. DCA ensures consistent exposure to the market, allowing your investments to compound continuously over time.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Magnitude of Market Growth\n\nOver the last decade, the S&P 500 experienced significant growth, driven by strong bull markets. In such conditions:\n\nRegular, consistent contributions (DCA) capture the upward trend.\n\nDips, when they occur, are often small or infrequent, leading to fewer opportunities to deploy extra capital.\n\nBy the time you add funds during a dip, the price recovery might already be underway, diminishing the potential advantage.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Psychological and Execution Risks\n\nEmotional Decision-Making: Even with a rules-based strategy, there\'s often hesitation or uncertainty when deploying additional funds in volatile periods.\n\nUnderestimation of Recovery Speed: After sharp declines, the S&P 500 often recovers faster than expected. If you\'re too slow to execute ""buy-the-dip"" contributions, you might miss the best prices, whereas DCA invests regardless of market conditions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Time in the Market > Timing the Market\n\nThe success of DCA stems from its simplicity and discipline. It avoids the pitfalls of timing the market and ensures that you are consistently investing during both high and low periods.\n\nBy contrast, ""buy-the-dip"" strategies rely on market timing to some extent. If the dips are infrequent or shallow, this approach can underperform, especially during strong bull markets.\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Market Conditions Over the Last Decade\n\nThe last 10 years have been marked by:\n\nA long bull market (2013‚Äì2020) with strong upward trends and relatively minor pullbacks.\n\nQuick recoveries from major dips, like the COVID-19 crash in 2020.\n\n\nIn such an environment, sticking to DCA often outperforms reactive strategies.\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Mathematical Explanation: Average Cost vs. Dip Buying\n\nDCA inherently benefits from ""buying low"" due to regular contributions during natural fluctuations. Dip buying may over-concentrate purchases during certain periods, potentially leading to higher average costs if the market recovers quickly or doesn\'t dip significantly.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhy ""Buying the Dip"" Works Better in Other Scenarios\n\nProlonged Bear Markets: During extended downturns, buying dips at significant drawdowns can meaningfully lower your average cost basis.\n\nVolatile Markets: In highly volatile environments with frequent and deep corrections, buying dips can capture more value than DCA.\n\n\nHowever, over the past decade, the S&P 500\'s trend was mostly upward, with only a few major dips. This environment made DCA the superior strategy.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nYour results are a valuable lesson in the importance of understanding market context and strategy alignment.

Simplest and no frills explanation.', ""I'm not accounting for cash held while calculating returns. It's only based on money invested in the index.\n\nBut overall, I agree with your logic.

Annualised I guess without compounding, yeah the difference would be kinda low.', ""You didn't understand the strategy.\n\nIt isn't about buying the bottom.

Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.\n\nAllowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance.

I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. \n\nGoogle might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer.

""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let\'s illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company\'s upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that\'s really an edge case and isn\'t relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company\'s stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn\'t restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you\'ve been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can\'t trade your own company\'s stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they\'re complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn\'t help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it\'s well-founded (I\'m not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don\'t understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don\'t know is illegal to use. This is made worse by the portrayal of insider trading in movies and television - that\'s absolutely not the case.', 'Thanks for ‚Äúsinsiders‚Äù, though! /s', 'Maybe you are saying the insider/unfair part is that they take the short position and then release their findings, and you are assuming that their findings/report will cause the stock to fall. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt insider trading.

Short sellers can short, say ""we think there is fraud going on, we have a price target of $0"" and then instantly close.\n\nThey cannot say ""we have a price target of $0 and we will be shorting shares for the next month"" and then close before the month.\n\nFor it to be a pump and dump it would have to be based on non-material information about the company (i.e. a bunch of people are about to buy or sell the stock is not material information about the company, they are committing fraud is material) or they would have to be dishonest with their timeframe.', 'With a pump and dump, you\'re normally pushing up the price of a thinly-traded stock where you are secretly buying large volumes. You shill positive info and at the same time, you are making the stock go up, all while knowing for certain that once you sell, the stock will tank.\n\nShortsellers are different. Taking a short position means they borrowed the stock and sold it already. They find some piece of negative info on the company and release it. If the market believes it, then stock drops. When they then have to cover their short positions, they get to buy the shares at a cheaper price, making profit, but they aren\'t manipulating the market directly because the shares going down is not guaranteed, unlike the stock going up in a pump and dump. \n\nIn other words, shilling a stock isn\'t a ""pump and dump"".

"/r/Stocks Weekend Discussion Saturday - Nov 23, 2024",AutoModerator,12,2024-11-23 10:30:16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,[],57,"['If you\'re familiar with Harry Browne\'s Permanent Portfolio, you know the entire idea is to match the performance of the market with a lower Sharpe ratio. By losing very little principal during drawdowns, it avoids the ""[volatility tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax)"" that crushes your long-term CAGR. In its original 1999 incarnation, the portfolio was divided according to this rubric:\n\n* 25% equities (can be represented by SPY)\n* 25% long-term bonds (can be represented by TLT)\n* 25% gold (can be represented by GLD)\n* 25% cash (can be represented by SHY or a savings account)\n\nRay Dalio\'s twist on it during the 2000s was to apply external leverage to juice returns. The original\'s Sharpe ratio was 0.6 and Dalio pushed it back up to 1, accruing better ROI with the same volatility as SPY. Recently Porter Stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities. The actual details behind his version are too long for this post, but the idea of internal leverage^1 to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind. \n\nFor the last six months I\'ve been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown. The key word here is *converted*: I was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with non-linear returns on short notice. During period of crisis for the bond market, long-term securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up. In such instances you are stuck with a ""risk free"" asset that\'s rapidly depreciating in value. Simultaneously I wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the Sharpe ratio - it forces your CAGR to converge with the general market during good times. We want a setup that outperforms when the market\'s hot and offers better principal protection when it\'s cold. \n\nAfter doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of May, I arrived at the following portfolio:\n\n* 30% equities, replacing SPY with high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria.\n* 30% gold and other precious/industrial metals, leveraged through exposure to high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria. \n* 20% income option strategies. They are characterized by a high win rate (ideally 75% and above), high profit factors, uniform application across equities, and a focus on frontrunning institutional moves based on taking advantage of *their* long-term strategies for generating wealth. We would use the Kelly Criterion to determine allocation and guard against disproportionate losses. These replace bonds entirely. \n* 20% cash, preferably in a MMF or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation. \n\nThe big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options. It probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative, but that\'s due to retail primarily using options for speculation. They don\'t employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk. Yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow.^2 All of them are based on exploiting how money flows through the structure of the market, not whether an individual stock/ETF will directionally move in our favor. The tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return, and the risk can be ameliorated.  \n\nThe arguments in favor of options over bonds are the following: \n\n* In theory, you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless. In reality, it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital. Unless you\'re running a 0DTE, you should never lose more than 25-30% before hitting the stop loss. \n* Since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions, they are agnostic to the state of the market. It doesn\'t matter if it is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways period. By contrast bonds rely on a disinflationary/deflationary environment to appreciate in value. In inflationary environments, bonds are doubly penalized: you lose on real yield returns and the underlying value is crushed as rates are hiked.\n* As these income option contracts are primarily short duration, the cash from premiums + returns can be invested into longer-dated puts during market corrections. At the bottom of bear markets, the cash flow can be diverted into equities.\n* Repeatable options strategies are not that rare. For example, there is a multi-leg setup that has a historical win rate of 90% with an average 20% return per winning transaction and a 17:1 profit factor. When we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week, you will generate roughly 600% return on that investment over 40 weeks. The general loss when it fails is 5-10% with an occasional dip below 20%. There are strategies based on gamma exposure, anchored VWAP on stocks with strong upwards/downward momentum, 0DTE credit spreads, selling contracts on blue-chips during periods of momentary weakness, etc. that succeed 80-95% of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters. The biggest obstacle to success is maintaining the discipline to avoid exposure to big losses. \n* As a corollary to 3 and 4, the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low Sharpe ratio. The returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis, which gives you the flexibility to rebalance portfolio distribution based on the state of the market. \n* The majority of principal dedicated to options is never in play at any particular point. It is technically cash until it\'s tied up into contracts - the wagered amount is sized according to the Kelly Criterion. In practice you\'ll have 35-40% of the portfolio in cash. While the inherent risk is higher for options than bonds, the overall risk to the portfolio is lower in the face of secular economic changes.\n\nThis is not a gameplan for passive investors. It requires a moderate amount of oversight. \n\n^1 The difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns. External leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt. This debt is independent of the investment\'s mechanics, such as a margin account. Internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset, treating the security as a second order derivative. Think of junior miners that go up 500%, 1000%, 5000% during a gold bull market. The key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility, using a combination of allocation size and selecting capital-efficient proxies with good management. Leveraged ETFs are not considered.\n\n^2 Bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable, predictable behavior from the former. In the case of the U.S. government, the holder assumes the government is both solvent and willing to fulfill their obligations. Guess what that also describes? An options contract. The difference is you, as a holder, are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control 80-85% of all transaction volume. In the aggregate they exhibit formulaic actions when rebalancing their portfolios, protecting their downside, and so on that is easily exploitable. It\'s this feature, not a promise to pay interest, that generates long-term cash flow.', 'Lots of these comments read like late 2021.', 'Citadel buys (a lot of) Intel stock, trims (a lot of) NVDA.\xa0\n\n\nCrazy? ü§£', 'As unhappy I am with the CROX acquisition of Hey Dude and how much of a drag it has been on the business, it is worth keeping in context that the business is otherwise cruising ahead.

The origin and size of the orders **do not** show up in the options chain - you need a scanning program that scraps and filters transactions across every platform from ThinkOrSwim to E-Trade.\n\nAlternately, market makers are forced to delta hedge when a stock's price approaches a large concentration of calls/puts at a particular strike. The gamma exposure leaves the options seller vulnerable to paying millions, oftentimes billions, if they don't cover their downside. Buying shares for hedging accelerates price movement to the strike itself.\n\n* Because these bids and the relevant information are hidden, it doesn't change the cost of the premiums. Think about how IV crush destroyed anyone who had bought NVDA contracts in the 3 days leading up to earnings. The market makers, those selling the contracts, fleeced retail with outrageous costs as long as demand stayed elevated. They knew that the options distribution constricted NVDA's possible upwards movement to 145, yet the call + put spread required NVDA to hit 154 to justify the risk. When huge bets are done secretly, you get a window where the risk/reward options structure is disproportionately in your favor. Market makers utilize mathematical models to determine the breakeven point when it's favorable to sell options at a profit. If the market at large knew who was betting and why, the premiums would adjust upwards to meet that point.\n* In the case of gamma exposure, you know the market maker cannot afford to do nothing when the price steadily climbs or drops towards that point. It could wipe out a significant portion of their allotted capital.

Much appreciated.\n\nYou are right that I failed to mention the diminishing returns with scaling generative AI models. This is a key issue. As models grow larger, the improvements in performance often become less pronounced compared to the exponential increase in computational costs. It's a known limitation of generative AI, and it partly explains why some experts are starting to question its long-term scalability.\n\nAs for alternative AI models, while they‚Äôre still in development, they're more than theoretical. Neuromorphic computing, for instance, is in use in some niche applications like robotics and low-power AI systems, and symbolic AI is making a comeback, especially in hybrid models that combine reasoning with machine learning. These approaches have their own set of challenges, but they‚Äôre being actively researched, and some promising work is being done outside the generative AI space.\n\nI agree with you that these alternative approaches aren‚Äôt as commercially developed as generative AI yet, but if funding continues to concentrate primarily on LLMs, we risk starving these other areas of innovation. It‚Äôs something to keep in mind as generative AI continues to dominate the investment landscape."", 'doesnt synthetic data reduce this pressure?', ""Another excellent response. It's funny --I wasn't sure whether I should post this here or in an AI subreddit, thinking that I might get a better response in the latter, but your comment and the others so far have been very insightful. Thank you for that.\n\nLike others above, you bring up some valid counterpoints, so I've tried to dig into them:\n\n* **On factually unreliable outputs (RAG and QA)**: I agree that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and incorporating human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms can help mitigate the issue of factually unreliable outputs, particularly for mission-critical applications. However, even with these safeguards, there are still fundamental challenges in ensuring that AI models can consistently distinguish fact from fiction across diverse domains. Human judgment will always play a crucial role in high-risk scenarios. It‚Äôs not just about tolerance for error; it‚Äôs about mitigating the consequences of those errors, especially in fields like healthcare, law, and finance, where the stakes are higher.\n* **On probabilistic reasoning (actuarial sciences)**: Point well taken! lol As you implied, in the actuarial sciences probabilistic models do make decisions based on data patterns without deep causal reasoning. But the difference here is that while actuarial science is successful in many domains, AI's current limitations in *causal* understanding still present problems in real-world applications, especially where critical decisions need to be made based on cause-and-effect logic. While we can get close to ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù we‚Äôre still far from a true understanding of the world, which will remain an important gap to address for more complex tasks.\n* **On computational costs (declining costs)**: Yes, there‚Äôs been progress in reducing token costs for generative models, and that‚Äôs encouraging. But I think the issue is not just per-token costs but the *overall* computational cost of training and running increasingly large models. While costs may decrease in the short-term, the sheer scale of AI models like GPT-4 and beyond means that AI infrastructure and energy demands will continue to grow, and this is something that may not be sustainable at large scales. Even with improvements in efficiency, the resource cost to scale generative AI models is something that needs to be addressed long-term.\n* **On limited real-world problem-solving abilities (AI orchestration)**: You‚Äôre right that we can teach AI more relevant real-world knowledge through orchestration and deeper learning. However, even with better training, models still struggle with complex decision-making that requires understanding context, ambiguity, and reasoning beyond what they‚Äôve been trained on. While progress is being made, true general problem-solving capability‚Äîlike what we see in human cognition‚Äîremains a significant challenge.\n\nLastly, I agree that we are early in the development of AI, and there‚Äôs a lot of potential ahead. But while there‚Äôs money to be made in the short-term, my concern is that the focus on generative AI may crowd out exploration into alternative, potentially more sustainable or transformative AI approaches. If the market corrects, as I suspect it may, we could see that funding for new paradigms gets squeezed.\n\nThanks again for the discussion! It‚Äôs really interesting to hear your take.

Apologies if this is an ignorant question; I am new to this.', '""What stops the spending?"" Exactly. One can never predict. Thanks for sharing your feedback.', 'You raise some valid counterarguments. Thank you for sharing. Here are my thoughts...\n\n* **On factual reliability (Point 1)**: It‚Äôs true that newer generations of models, including ChatGPT, are working to improve factual accuracy. But even with future advancements, achieving full reliability is challenging due to the inherent nature of probabilistic models. Fine-tuning and incorporating better data sources will help, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get to a point where these models are consistently trustworthy, especially in high-stakes domains like law or medicine.\n* **On probabilistic reasoning with constraints (Point 2)**: The idea of narrowing the gap with probabilistic reasoning is interesting. However, AI still lacks true causal reasoning and comprehension. While we may be able to make outputs look more human-like, it won‚Äôt necessarily lead to true understanding. So, while ""good enough"" might work in many situations, there are domains where deeper reasoning will always be required.\n* **On AI improving energy industries (Point 3)**: It‚Äôs true that AI is being used to optimize energy production in various sectors, which is a good thing. However, the computational demands of training large-scale models like GPT-4 are still enormous, and it‚Äôs unclear how sustainable this is in the long run. Even with improvements in energy efficiency, the resource cost of scaling up models to meet future demands could be problematic.', ""and imagine thinking AI capabilities won't get better.

It‚Äôs very risky either way you choose and unless you have a strong conviction and do a lot of research (well beyond this comment) it can end badly. The stock market is also not very rational, so you could have the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer and still be wrong (i‚Äôll elaborate)\n\n1. You could short sell the stock. This is basically taking out a ‚Äúloan‚Äù for how ever many shares you short sell, and selling those shares immediately at their current price. You are then obliged to buy the shares back (at a predetermined date when you set up the trade). So as an example, if you short sold 5 shares of mstr at 200 a little while ago and had to buy it back today, you would lose (~425-200)*5=~1125. \n\n2. Buy put options on the stock. Basically, this gives you the option to sell the stock at a certain price on a certain date. These will swing wildly in value with stock price swings, but you are not forced to execute a losing position. Instead, you lose money on the option contract itself.\n\nNow that thats out of the way, if you were to short a stock and bet correctly, you can make a lot. If you short sold djt or bought puts on it on election day/night at somewhere between 35-45 per share, and iirc it dropped to ~20 within like 4 days, your options wouldve killed it, and your short wouldve been way up (depending how many shares you bought).\n\nHowever, stock prices are not always rational. Something could be overvalued and still keep going up (hello palantir). While the correction could happen and your bet could pay off huge, its just as possible that the stock just keeps rising until your option contract expires or you have to buy back the shares. (‚ÄúRight‚Äù answer but still wrong/wrong timing)\n\nI hope this was helpful - i‚Äôm going to reiterate once more, please do not start trading options or short selling if you are still an entry level trader unless you have thoroughly researched what you are doing, the stock, and are comfortable risking the amount you put down. Look at wallstreetbets to see how that turns out for people who do not do that', ""On factual reliability - you're assuming that humans have more factual reliability at every point.

Generative ai is an improvement to the tools we have currently, and will inevitably make better more resourceful workers.\n\nOn energy, you're right it's unclear just how fast u.s. power needs will grow. However the US in particular has vast amounts of untapped natural resources that can be used to produce more energy. Desert space for solar farms, rocky foothills for wind farms, much untapped land for mining natural gas and other resources. And the revitalization of nuclear programs will help too. If things become dire, we will likely see big investments from the AI companies themselves into these energy companies to both diversify and help meet needs.

Most of the Lampert era of Sears was a long vs short saga that lasted over a decade - it eventually was largely Lampert and former ""Morningstar Manager of the Decade"" Berkowitz on one side and the shorts on the other. There were tremendous short squeezes at times in Sears all the way down, but the closer it go to 0 the shorter they lasted. There were people posting at $2 that ""Eddie Lampert is a billionaire, he has a plan!"" Yes, he did - a plan for himself loaning the company money against the company\'s best real estate - heads I win, tails I win. It went from Business Week covers talking about how Lampert was going to create his Berkshire Hathway to eventual bankruptcy.\n\nI think that we\'re in an odd period where things have turned into memes or recovered in a fashion that would otherwise be unusual in the past. AMC has been able to dilute shareholders incessantly. If this was several years ago, it probably would have been a 0 already rather than the meme boost and the constant equity raises after that have been tolerated. Yellow went bankrupt then went up 600% before cratering. There are people who still think that Bed Bath and Beyond\'s bankruptcy is a massive conspiracy. SAVEQ seems to be the latest in the line of these - Gamestop\'s short squeeze seems to have taught a generation of investors that ""bad is not bad"", every poorly run company/mediocre business is a potential meme/short squeeze and anyone who has a different opinion is somehow conspiring against them. \n\nIn investing sometimes people are going to have differing opinions than you about your investments. Sometimes those people are going to have bigger platforms to broadcast their views. Sometimes those people are going to be right. Sometimes those people aren\'t right but maybe you read what they have to say and they make some good points - they aren\'t ultimately right but some of it makes you think and see your investment perhaps in ways you previously haven\'t. If you read what they have to say and still think you\'re right, you thank them for the opportunity and buy lower.\n\nInvesting is a life long learning experience and imo, people should be open to maybe learning from people who don\'t share the same opinion. \n\nIt\'s really only the last 5 years that any time there\'s a short discussion people run and post about ""MANIPULATION!!!"" Meanwhile, what would those people say if they were short the stock and the report was someone who was long? People have less ire towards pump and dump scams (hot quantum computing stock QUBT was ""Innovative Beverage Company"" not that long ago - keep in mind Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain wasn\'t that many years ago) than they do towards someone who has a negative opinion on a popular retail long.  It\'s the Simpsons meme: ""Could I be wrong?"" ""No, it must be a short seller conspiracy.""\n\nNot everyone is going to share your opinion on your investments and be open to the idea that maybe they can make an interesting point you hadn\'t considered or be right. People rant about how any sort of short anything is ""manipulation"" but we\'re in a time period where people seem far less tolerant in investing to any opinion that isn\'t theirs. There was a time where Reddit wasn\'t full of little echo chamber stock-specific subreddits where people go to hear everyone agree with them and people could have differing opinions on here and it actually sometimes lead to good discussions rather than just insta-downvotes and/or being scolded for not agreeing with a prevailing trend/opinion on something.\n\n If you read what they have to say and still disagree, thank them for the opportunity and buy more - that\'s it.

If a stock is depressed after short reports and doesn't eventually rebound, perhaps the fundamentals were less than people thought.

Did you know that the EU exports $400bn yearly to the US, while the US exports ""only"" $230bn to the EU? \n\nA tariff situation would be horrible for both parties because:\n\n1. The EU makes a lot of money from exporting to the US and obviously does not want to lose that. Losing too much of that would be deflationary (as demand would drop significantly). And no one wants deflation. \n\n2. The US obviously needs a lot of what it\'s buying from the EU, and making it more expensive is going to drive up the cost to the end consumer, contributing to inflation in the process. \n\nDid you know that the US\' imports of European goods is almost as large as its imports of Chinese goods? $400bn vs $500bn. Despite what you hear in the US with stuff like ""oh we buy everything from China, we are so dependent on China"" and so on. You are almost just as dependent on the EU.

Viking will need significant resources to carve out market share.\n\nlastly, the issue of insurance coverage is critical.

Also, BioNTech rose to prominence during its COVID-19 vaccine development with Pfizer, achieving substantial valuation gains after early-stage clinical success. This will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts I provided.\n\n2: The market for Viking is dominating looking as of now. I've responded to someelse to, but here let me restate the comparative advantage of Viking. First is tolerability, for Mounjaro, common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, typical of GLP-1 agonists. But with VK2735, participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms. I'd also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of Mounjaro due to side effects, now compare the frequency to Viking. For Mounjaro, participants achieved an average weight loss of 15-22.5% of body weight over 72 weeks, depending on the dose (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg). This means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame. Compare this to Viking which is NOTABLY only in its Phase 2 mid-stage trial, participants experienced a 15% weight loss over just 13 weeks. Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. These all prove that Viking has a clear comparative edge as of now, unless you can disprove these facts.\n\n3: I think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term. But in the long run, I believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition; it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions. Effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications, so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment. \n\nIf you still maintain your position, I really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day, I'm just an average investor looking for more insights.""]"

""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let\'s illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company\'s upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that\'s really an edge case and isn\'t relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company\'s stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn\'t restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you\'ve been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can\'t trade your own company\'s stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they\'re complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn\'t help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it\'s well-founded (I\'m not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don\'t understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap.

They can chat on the phone, in person, via email, via snail mail, using cryptic communications etc.', 'Marjorie Taylor Greene bought a shit load of Crowdstrike right before their outage and lost a ton of money on them lol.', 'Insider trading is a major fact of life. Like speeding, it‚Äôs only caught sometimes.', 'NANC', ""So basically a wallet degen has to run for Congress and let the rest of us know what he's doing?"", 'Are there laws in the US against insider trading?', 'Check out the folks that bought puts on airline stocks for 9/11', 'I got caught for insider trading and fined. Friend of a friend of a friend said to buy some puts/calls. I bought like 100 of them, made 100k over 3 earnings periods.  Fine was 2x win plus the 100k in attorney fees. I didn‚Äôt know it was someone inside company until last trades I made. Sec don‚Äôt care.\n\nThe people above me made millions, they got fines plus probation and one got jail time.\n\nMy attorney said they never go after my level but it probably had to prosecute the others with more charges.', 'Technically not insider trading.\n\nIt‚Äôs an upgrade version when they signed something into law and make a trade of affected stock of affected industry prior to said law coming into effect.\n\nThis is why Pelosi Tracker has the highest return so far', '[deleted]', '> There isn‚Äôt really a way to police it. I‚Äôd wager that it goes on a lot more than we know and very few will ever get caught/prosecuted.\n\nPart of what I do revolves around policing this stuff.  It\'s not easy, but trade and comms surveillance is one place where AI is making huge strides in finding uncommon patterns, both in trade activity and in the language used in communication channels (email, whatsapp, SMS, etc.).\n\nIt\'s not a huge step from clearly suspicious activity across a few mediums to a personal phone records subpoena, and bam.  Busted.\n\nThere\'s no way to truly know how much insider info is being exchanged and acted upon illegally, but certainly the new tools are finding maybe 3x more than we were just a few years ago.  I\'d say we\'re now catching maybe 15%-20% of this kind of non-compliant activity.\n\nEDIT:  If you work for a broker-dealer, I will tell you *everything* you do any any corporate issued device is captured and analysed.  All your email, Bloomberg messages, Symphony chats, Teams, SMS, MMS, desk phone, turret, etc., etc., it\'s all captured, stamped with you as the ""custodian"" of that info, and run through sophisticated monitoring tools.  If you wouldn\'t be comfortable with it appearing on the front page of NYT, don\'t write/say it on a corporate device.', 'There‚Äôs a way to punish after the fact. Need someone who has the balls to do so. Get caught, you are now fined the initial investment, plus your profit, plus 3x the aggregate amount. You will also be sent to federal prison without parole.
