lzo1c50,rlovepalomar,I think the investments and doubled down investments in rivian will be tripled down to see them make it through otherwise it spells great trouble for more than just rivian and their seed investors. However I don’t think rivian will be a formidable EV auto company in the market anytime soon but then again the market is irrational. That being said 100/share would be crazy for them since they’re just a luxury adventure EV auto company and basically not much more. Sure they had the Amazon delivery van deal but aside from n that they don’t currently  generate enough organic demand from the market to sustain the prices of their models especially at the volume they need to b produce them in order to achieve profitability,14,1732940756.0,t3_1h3465k

Well first of all, the system used to work differently — it displayed both upvote and downvote totals, not just a sum. This helped to dispel the illusion that a certain viewpoint was unanimous — seeing “+1200 -800” is different than seeing “+400”.

Secondly, people honestly used the site differently 10 years ago. They were a lot less liable to downvote simply because of a disagreement. 

> When you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it, i think it’s a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page.

Why?? 

This literally means that in a thread about a topic where 60% of commenters think *x* and 40% think *y*, you’ll basically only see *x* because *y* gets downvoted. This is how echo chambers persist.  It means you’re always seeing the most popular take. Is that really how conversations should be?

> Whats social media ISNT an echo chamber 


Classic Internet forums are much more akin to real life conversations because they’re chronological order. Twitter has the “community notes” feature where a viewpoint doesn’t have to be 50%+ to get posted at the top, it just has to be rated as helpful by enough people, and since the platform’s algorithm seeks engagement, often controversial or disagreement takes are right under the original tweet. Reddit is definitely the most powerful echo chamber factory.",15,1732821705.0,t1_lzf05r7

Meanwhile, liberals work off of unattainable utopia dreams and has too much infighting amongst themselves, which is a flaw but it doesn’t relish in misinformation in the same way conservative outlets do. 

So you can say redditors mostly lean left because it’s the redditors upvoting that content, not Reddit itself 

But also, like i said, the filtering system works most of the time anyways. If you ever look at a thread with hundreds or thousands of comments, you can clearly see WHY people are downvoted. It’s often cause they have poor writing skills, poor argument skills, and often include wrong information or just filled with nasty, hateful rhetoric. 

I am perfectly happy with this filtering system. I upvote good quality comments and downvote lazy, shitty comments. 

Only rarely, very rarely, do i genuinely feel shock seeing a comment be downvoted and think “huh, why is this being downvoted it’s a quality comment?” Most often than not, the shitty comments are the ones being downvoted.

The subsequent orders from defense contractors would ramp in '27. Intel has stated overall external foundry revenue would be 1 billion by end of 26. So it's quite small for a while. 


 I'm long the stock, but you have to be realistic foundry business will take time. And we don't know when market will realize it's value. If Intel went to 30, 35 or 40 next year. It's not because of foundry businesses revenue. ",1,1732930781.0,t1_lzn2qp6

lzes4bc,Dirtey,"Yeah, people need to learn how to separate these companies. Intel is mainly competing with AMD(x86 CPU design) and TSMC (chip manufacturer that produces chips for literally everyone except Intel). Just because AMD also is competing hard against Nvidia on the GPU/Ai side does not mean Nvidia is one of Intels main competitors.

It is Intels ambitions to go after TSMC monopoly on high-end production that interests me, especially since they got uncle sam in their corner. 

I am not even certain of the X86 CPU future in general, which will affect both Intel and AMD. So strictly talking about who is in the lead here between Intel or AMD might not even matter long term.",3,1732804259.0,t1_lzd4ii4

lzeq9qb,Dirtey,"I would argue you get pretty far looking at benchmarks in this business with very basic understanding of the underlying effects. But one thing I constantly see people get wrong is the fact that Intel fumbled their foundry ball, which made AMD appear to be quite far ahead thanks to TSMC foundries pulling ahead of Intel for certain generations. People at least need to learn how to separate the foundry side and the design side in other words, which I count as basic understanding.

People also need to realize that a quite big portion of their income is not from the consumer market, which means things like leaps on power efficiency might have a better effect on earnings than making the best gaming CPU.

Sure, it helps to be a engineer that understand the underlying shit. But in businesses where we get as accurate benchmarks as we do in this one becomes fairly easy to understand just because of that fact.",6,1732803535.0,t1_lzdpgrr

lzeqoxa,wm313,"That’s just people parroting other people’s comments because they can’t provide any real information and just want to talk. 

Your trading app hopefully provides information on stocks you are interested in. You can use P/E ratios and charts to get a general idea. Then there’s looking into revenue year over year to see how it has been performing plus what businesses the company is currently dealing in. Looking at debt. All those small factors.

Then there’s having intuition about a stock’s position relative to the market and what they deal in. Example, we all know AI is the hottest boom right now. Outside of the major FAANG companies I wanted to find something secondary to these companies that flew under the radar. I found Vertiv, partly because I see their equipment, and I realized they’re being used everywhere, so I bought them last May. It has paid off. Then I take potential into account. I sat on buying RDDT themselves forever. Realizing that they’re driving more user engagement and having ties to Google, plus other social media companies losing user bases, I took a small (very small) position out of hope to see what happens. 

Outside of all that, I look at what the biggest ETFs hold. FAANG companies are at the top so it’s smart to mirror them in a way while also finding those rare opportunities in companies after reading articles about the business. The problem is some people follow the advice of Reddit, or a random YouTuber who got lucky with a one random stock, without trying to understand a business. I just heard about WOLF for the first time last week after they made the top gainers list one day.since then I’ve seen 5-10 people post about it, talking about how great the business is. That’s a red flag for me. These same people saw the same $6-$7 stock, probably read some comments, and now want to see it balloon to $20-$30 for a quick profit. They have no long-term plan. They just want to turn their $2K into $6K in a couple weeks to make a quick profit. So don’t follow trends. Follow stability and growth in a business that doesn’t have shady practices. Don’t chase a stock because it’s “cheap”. Invest in companies that make sense to you; not because you believe they’ll double in a short span of time.",4,1732803700.0,t1_lzebg9a
lzepgod,Dirtey,"Not to mention how quickly AMD turned the tables with Ryzen. The progress they made first with Ryzen release and then how fast it progressed between the 2000 series and 5000(X3D) is quite insane.

Intels comeback with Core 2 Duo was legendary as well, after being complete shit as a consumer for several years before that. Even though they managed to maintain way more market shares than they should have.

As you said they didn't create any new nodes and were stuck on 14/10 nm for ages. Not the case now. In fact, they are even with their new Xeon processors. Arrow lake (Ultra 200) should be ignored because they are TSMC chips and not Intel chips.

lz58ph3,Chilkoot,"> What am I missing?

Valuations rely heavily on future prospects, which means how players are positioned in growth markets.  Why is Intel's outlook poor?

* Intel's bread-and-butter is the x86 market.  x86 is currently a negative growth market, and that's unlikely to change.  They will squeeze a ton of revenue out of x86 for many years, but it's ultimately stagnant at *best*.

* Intel has been trying to diversify into the discrete GPU market.  Unfortunately, it just leaked yesterday that their new B770 die hasn't even taped out yet, and both performance and thermals are way below expectations.  It may never see the light of day, which means Intel will have no serious discrete GPU offering this generation.

* Both AMD and NVDA are burning the midnight oil to release their Windows-on-ARM APU's by Xmas 2025.  More WoA is bad for Intel, not just for CPU sales, but for x86 licensing fees.  No one knows yet if WoA will impact x86 sales seriously, but it's a real possibility for the 24-36 month horizon.

* The one thing Intel has *really* done right lately - Lunar Lake - is being changed significantly in the next gen.  They are moving RAM off-die to save $$ and reduce the cost to market to be more competitive with... you guessed it... ARM APU's.  It's a real gamble.  If they can't make up for added latency and really boost multi-core, it could be a major blow to them.

You can’t compare Rivian today vs Tesla Today. Rivian didn’t start selling cars until late 2021 (we’re just hitting the 3 year mark). Tesla sold the Model S starting in 2012 and didn’t hit a full year of profit as a company until 2020. So if you want to compare these companies, do so to Tesla in 2015. Even then, the EV market today was very different to the market in 2015 so things still won’t be apples to apples.

Rivian has a great brand, its leadership is non problematic, and people hold their cars to higher regard.

It could make sense, but it depends on what's the goal of the credit is and what people really want. Do you want more EVs sold and to maximally help combat climate change, or do you want more EV competition in the marketplace?

As someone that doesn't particularly like Tesla or Musk, the policy change rubs me the wrong way. Presumably the goal of the credit was originally put in place to combat climate change and get more EVs on the road. It feels like they're tweaking the policy away from its original goal into a different goal, solely because Musk is a dick.

1. 40% of Tesla profits come from the selling of EV credits to other manufacturers who do not meet the emissions standards.  Those credits are given by the government.  Tesla could choose not to sell them. They do, accepting the subsidy. 

2.  Tesla agreed to open to its super charger network to non teslas - guess why? To be able to get federal funds for building out its network.  Elon could’ve kept the network an exclusive perk, but he wanted the build out subsidized. 

3.  Tesla took massive tax breaks to move manufacturing to Texas.  Sure loves those subsidies. 

4.  Yes the tax credit is to the consumers, but if Elon is so anti subsidy, there’s an argument that he shouldn’t be promoting the subsidy on the Tesla car page.

lz1gnv0,meltingman4,"1. Regulatory credits are not subsidies. The idea here is to encourage vehicle manufacturers (and other industries) to reduce carbon emissions by producing more efficient vehicles and transition to Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEV) in the future. Each company is granted an allowance based on some defined regulatory criteria. Since Tesla only makes ZEV's, they have a net credit. Other companies, like Stelantis, that hasn't done much of anything to reduce emissions, can purchase these credits from Tesla to offset their excess.

This is a consequence of companies being slow to adopt cleaner carbon emissions policy. Can't really blame this on Tesla.

2. Tesla already has the largest network of superchargers. Funds for EV charging network expansion are awarded to each state that applies for a grant to support an expansion project. Contracts are awarded to companies that bid for the right to work on the project. This is not exclusive to Tesla.

Tesla has received $28.8 million in funding for 69 sites as part of the NEVI plan. 

3. Most states give tax breaks to companies that setup large scale manufacturing operations, often bringing with them tens of 1000's of jobs. This is done in practically every sector. Intel is expected to receive $5 billion in federal funding to build chips. I understand why that's important, but why does Intel reap all the benefit?

When Tesla was first ramping up, they did get a low interest loan for $485 million to build a factory under an ATVM program. Ford got over $5 billion! Tesla paid the loan off in 2013 (9 years early) while Ford has repaid nothing. Also around that time, GM got a $50 billion bailout while Stelantis received  about $18 billion.

lz26489,chronicpenguins,"You should look up what the definition of a subsidy is.  They come in many forms.  The government created a program to encourage a behavior, in this program it also discourages another behavior.  It is a government incentive (subsidy) to produce electric cars.  The credits are handed out by the government, and they let the market decide how much it is worth.   Therefore, the government is indirectly paying companies to produce electric cars by mandating a quota against ICE vehicles sold.    This effectively subsidizes the price of an electric vehicle.  It’s actually a beautiful subsidy from an economics perspective because of the “free market” aspect - companies can decide the balance of ICE vs EV, and pay for their externalities by purchasing credits from others.  If all companies decide to meet the regulation on their own, the subsidy is effectively worth zero because the goal has been met.  

If the government taxed emissions and used that tax money to distribute it to EV manufacturers, you would consider that a subsidy.  In emissions trading, companies opt to buy credits in lieu of fines from manufacturers with surplus. The money is changing hands still, the behavior is still be incentivized, it is just the market deciding the price.  Regardless, they are both government regulations in an attempt to price a negative externality and incentivize (subsidize) a behavior. 

2. I don’t see how that matters if it is a subsidy or not, the government is subsidizing EV infrastructure.  Everything you said could apply to oil or farm subsidies. 

3.  Still a subsidy. I don’t see the intel CEO saying they should repeal the Chips act. 

No one is saying the government doesn’t hand out subsidies, or that only Tesla gets subsidies from the government.  Subsidies are a crucial tool that the government has to encourage behavior, usually for the good of the country / economy.  I actually think they should exist.  What I don’t think should be happening is someone taking advantage of those subsidies, then turning their back on them, especially if they claim they are building EVs to solve climate change.

Size-asymmetric competition stifles innovation so when you are rapidly trying to grow an industry to compete from a global standpoint it opens up the potential of being left in the dust by foreign producers. 

This makes this type of legislation unnecessary in a lot of the industries you mentioned especially the ICE Industry because it’s already established and can only see very minimal improvements compared to EVs which is a rapidly growing and very strategic market. 

China and other countries are focusing a lot on EV development so if we allow for these inefficiencies in the domestic market the US is going to lose a lot of the global market share and eventually the domestic market demands will be met by foreign producers because Tesla can afford to only be making minimal changes and still maintain advantage over companies with smaller sales volume in the short term. This is why musk wants to end all EV subsidies because without them the market isn’t as competitive and they don’t have to spend or focus as much on innovation and can basically just coast along. 

Meanwhile foreign companies are pouring hundreds of billions into R&D that will create a lot of advantages for them in the long term and If foreign companies are able to win this race in the EV market then the US misses out on a lot of job creation and also becomes more reliant on a foreign economy which usually isn’t as big a deal as people make it in other industries but in one as strategic as EVs it is important. 

In regards to your question about solar panel support this legislation on EVs isn’t supporting the corporations through subsidies but rather giving subsidies to the consumers who then create a more balanced and competitive market because smaller companies become more appealing. 

In solar and other green energy development the support is much more complex and we actually do provide credits directly to the producers and manufacturers for R&D costs in addition to consumer based subsidies that incentives spending on the products. 

Tesla actually does qualify for the ITC which is a lot like the one being proposed for EVs they just don’t qualify for other subsidies because they aren’t a manufacturer or developer on a lot of these products and rather is a middleman on clean energy so they don’t qualify for as much because they can’t impact the market nearly much as a middleman compared to the actual individuals on the ends of the transactions like the producers and consumers .

Yes EV manufacturers and ICE manufacturers do source their parts from other economies but the actual final assembly portion is very beneficial 
 and provides a lot of jobs and benefits to the US economy through these jobs as well as tax revenue. if foreign car companies see more volume in EV sales then we are set to lose out on these benefits. 

Like I said before the actual company doesn’t receive the subsidies the consumer does. The benefits to the corporation is in the form of being able to more efficiently compete in the market. 

That being said even though they don’t directly receive the subsidies they do allow for smaller corporations to take different strategies like make improvements on receiving from better producers. When you have size-asymmetrical competition this doesn’t happen because the small companies typically have to focus solely on being a cheaper option to gain market share and can’t try and focus on higher quality unless they have extremely large amounts of money to use for start up costs. 

Yes tesla is one of the largest manufacturers of energy storage and is building a lot of facilities but they already receive supply side subsidies on this portion of energy based operation and doesn’t have anything to do with what you said in your comment before you changed it to remove that portion.

**Is MSTR is Levered Bitcoin?**

Emphatically, no it is not. Not since several years ago. It has (approximate numbers) a 100B market cap and has 33B of BTC. It trades at a 3x premium to its NAV. That is the opposite of ""Levered BTC"". For every $1 of MSTR you buy, your BTC exposure is literally $0.33. You don't get more than $1 of exposure, you get significantly less.

**Why is it moving like levered BTC then?**

MSTR's moves are a truly astonishing phenomenon in our markets today, up there in the annals of history with stock movements such as GME in Jan 2021. There are a number of reasons why it is moving like this, including:

 * **(1)** Catalysts, such as the MSTR BTC yield, Saylor's big BTC buys, and Trump winning, put MSTR on a lot of people's radar, and the buying started. 
 * **(2)** Leveraged funds such as MSTX and MSTU own over 10B of exposure MSTR, and have to buy a lot on up days, and they contribute to the runaway rally. If MSTR is up 10% on the day, these two funds together will have to buy 1B of MSTR, which is 1% of the company. Note that most stocks don't even have 1% of their shares trade in a day.
 * **(3)** Various short sellers and call sellers have been hurt by certain initial moves, and have had to close, pushing the rally even further. See for example the r/thetagang guy.
 * **(4)** Various hedge funds were short MSTR and long BTC because it was trading at a premium of 1.5x NAV, and that premium kept increasing, causing people to have to close their books at a massive loss.

This list is by no means exhaustive, please add any other reasons you can think of below.

They buy whether BTC is flat, lowering, raising in value. 

Most people that invest in it are anticipating that BTC will be more valuable than it is today. It’s overweight today but MSTR is still buying more BTC (secretly behind the scenes) by the time it gets announced publically, the price is sometimes locked in at a average cost of $10-15k per btc cheaper.

A few of the investing books I read talked about how some ""serial acquirers"" used to be able to print money due to dumb investors. Basically it worked like this, say you're a tech company that's given a high 20+ PE ratio. If you buy up a completely unrelated company with a 10 PE ratio, that has equivalent earnings to yours, then dumb investors will suddenly value the earnings of the 10 PE company at a 20 PE, meaning your acquisition has just immediately printed you money. And as long as investors are dumb enough to keep giving you a higher PE ratio, you can keep buying up completely unrelated companies with low PE ratios to continue printing money. And from the perspective of the dumb investors giving you the 20 PE ratio you've just increased your earnings a bunch, so maybe they'll decide that you're worthy of an even higher PE ratio now.

But then it all falls apart when investors get smarter and realize that you're just a bunch of completely unrelated businesses that the market values at a low PE ratio, meaning your stock and it's PE ratio drops a ton. And worse yet, most of the businesses you acquired are probably being mismanaged and seeing an earnings decline because the serial acquirer knows nothing about how to properly manage a business in all those different segments.",9,1732586396.0,t1_lywvsvi

When a company issues shares, investors are buying them because of the company's ability to generate cash now or in the future. When Microstrategy sells shares, investors get nothing but an asset at 1/3 of its value. Companies are meant to trade above book value because they generate value, MSTR only trades above it because it has a scheme to bring in more investors and increase BTC/share. That's not just a speculative bubble and sounds like a pyramid scheme to me. The exception to what I've described is commodities which don't generate cash but hold some (perceived) value, which is what bitcoin itself is, and meme stocks like GameStop where weird market forces take over.

lz3ugda,mtnbcn,"I get that argument.  I was talking about the bonds.  I'm not super familiar with the process of convertible bonds.

The attraction to MSTR is that they are going to issue more zero-coupon bonds, and use that to buy more bitcoin.  So instead of buying 1 bitcoin, you could buy 1-bitcoin worth of shares worth of MSTR.  As you rightly point out, the 1-bitcoin-worth-of-MSTR-shares costs much more (like 3 or 4 times the value of the company's bitcoin). The idea is the 1-bitcoin is always worth the price of 1-bitcoin, whatever it may be.  Meanwhile, MSTR is basically getting free money on the promise of higher stock prices, which they turn into more bitcoin. 

So let's say you buy 1000 shares of MSTR now at $400,000, which is worth 1 bitcoin, or $95,000.  The company is going to increase their holdings of bitcoin by 5-10fold, which means you'll have $480,000 to $950,000 worth of bitcoin in the future.  So your $400,000 worth of MSTR looks cheap by comparison.

I can't believe I'm defending MSTR, but here we are.

So what's the hole to poke in this argument?  I'd say that MSTR, by issuing this convertible bonds, is diluting their share count.  So if your 1000 shares currently entitle you to 1 bitcoin worth of shares in the company, in the future you might be diluted 2 or 3 times, so your shares are only worth .5 bitcoin or .33 bitcoin.  Now, when they increase their holdings 5-10 fold.... you'll have 5\*.4 to 10\*.4 bitcoin, or about 3 bitcoin worth of shares.

3 bitcoin times 95,000 = 285,000, or a MSTR shareprice of $285.

So MSTR is still severely overvalued.  It's just a way for the company to make money off the backs of its shareholders.  The emperor Saylor has no clothes.",2,1732642799.0,t1_lz319qg

lz2wf8g,Doin_the_Bulldance,"Ah, man, I remember my first time investing. You are parroting what the media says about the markets, but none of that is true. Mechanically, what makes a stock trade at a ""fair"" value based on cash flows? It's supply and demand. When a stock is fundamentally overvalued, traders might see that and sell their position (or even short it). And as there are more people trying to sell at the current ask than there are buyers, the ask will creep downward until there is something close to equilibrium. Of course, that ignores the fact that a market maker can put their thumb on the scale, but mechanically, that's the idea. 

If millions of people flip their 401k to auto-invest on broad indexes like the S&P 500, do you think that every 2 weeks they are checking to make sure that APPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, etc. are all at an ""appropriate"" value based on cash flows? Of course not. So that right there shows how there can be a huge demand for tickers with zero regard for fundamental analysis.

""Meme Stock"" is a nonsense term meant to degrade the sentiment (and ultimately value) of stocks that large institutions have short positions on. Their crazy volatility is almost never due to actual ""crazed"" retail sentiment alone - and in reality, it's completely undefined. Was Tootsie Roll a meme stock? It had huge amounts of short interest and moved along with gamestop and other ""memes"" during their runups, and was written about as a meme in several articles like [this one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/01/27/not-just-gamestop-here-are-the-meme-stocks-wallstreetbets-traders-are-pumping-up-during-this-extremely-erratic-reddit-rally/).  Meanwhile they are profitable quarter after quarter and have a healthy balance sheet - was it really ""crazed redditors"" that caused them to spike in cycles just like the other memes? Did you personally see a lot of Tootsie Roll memes and posts on reddit?

My point is this; cash flow is one factor in determining a stocks value, but it is not the only one and to pretend that there is some calculation you can do to get the ""proper"" value of a stock would mean that sentiment, future prospects, and market mechanics in general play no role.

If they dilute 50%, and increase their bitcoin holdings 2 or even 3 times, you are still down, underwater, in NAV.

There is no free money, so either they have to promise future dilution to get their money, or they have to take out loans and take-on debt (which is risky and can get expensive).

The only good argument I can see here is if you think it is a good idea \*to take out a loan to buy bitcoin\*.

This is moving away from the point though. The real point of my previous reply was that investing is not fundamentally based on greater fool theory.

Sorry if I hurt your feelings, Mr. P_e_n_i_sss, it's just that you're fundamentally wrong. 

Sentiment matters. And demand/supply for shares trump all.

Imagine 2 companies that were exactly the same in every way, except that one had a more likeable leadership team. Not a more competent one - just more likeable. Do you think that maybe more investors would buy one over the other even though future cash flows and current asset values were identical?

Imagine now that a bunch of billionaires got together, and for whatever reason decided that they'd each buy 4.99% of a random ticker (just under the filing threshold). Say that thaey have no plans to change the company in any way, they're just doing this because they were bored. 

So the public has no idea they are buying, there is nothing fundamentally changing about the companies future cash flows - but guess what? The stock will go up due to all the buy pressure.

Just because it *makes sense* to value a company based solely on expected cash flows doesn't mean that's magically what will happen. Over the long term, it's probably a very strong correlation, but its not the only factor and it's not black and white. Humans aren't always rational and the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, as they say.

And no to your last point. You wouldn't just own bitcoin. You'd own all of Microstrategy's IP, including their products, and all their other assets. There is definitely ""potential"" value in intangibles like brand recognition, too. A public company does not get 100% of it's value from hard asset values, cash flows, or any other ""fundamentals.""

lysauuq,Sanhen,"Yeah, I can't think of a company that can buy Chrome that wouldn't have similar monopoly issues. Plus, Chromium is open source, so it wouldn't be that difficult for Google to simply start a new browser unless the ruling forbids them from doing so.

So I'm not sure how selling Chrome is realistic or helpful when it comes to stopping monopolies. Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.

Allowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance. I could see those happening.

Ultimately, I'm wondering how much Google's search business will end up impacted by the rise of ChatGPT, especially with OpenAI also dipping directly into search. I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. 

Google might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer. A negative feeling towards a company also makes consumers less willing to expand the number of products from that company they're using, which will perhaps work against Google as they try to compete in the AI space.

You do realize there would not be any LLMs without Google?

They are who have made the huge innovations to make possible.  Not just Attention is all you need but so many other fundmental AI breakthroughs have come from Google.

If you look at the last 10 years and papers accepted at the canonical AI research organization, NeurIPS, Google has led every single year in papers accepted.

The last one Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.   Most of the last 10 years Google was #1 and #2 as they use to breakout DeepMind from Google Brain.

Google makes the HUGE breakthrough, patents it, then shares in a paper.  But then what is so unusual about Google is the fact they then let anyone use for completely free.    I think this fact is why you probably do not know how much of the most important innovations from the last 20 years have come from Google.

Your public IP address is dynamically assigned by your ISP from a block of IP addresses they own.

Your modem gets a unique IP address--modems cannot share a single IP address that would create an IP conflict. That's basic TCP/IP networking 101.

Your IP address may be dynamic, but it is certainly not anonymous. You may get x.x.x.12 today and x.x.x.182 tomorrow, but the MAC address of your modem is registered with your ISP. Otherwise, they wouldn’t extend you an IP lease.

You’re describing Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). Packets are forwarded to your public IP, and then your edge router routes traffic to private IPs on your LAN. In this case, yes, clients behind the NAT have a sort of anonymity unless someone has access to your MAC tables.

There is no browser ""fingerprint."" It's a combination of browser build, device OS build, that is unique. You can also very easily spoof your browser agent.

CHORUS uses advanced SAR bands (e.g., C-band and X-band) to deliver tailored solutions for different industries, a level of flexibility that earlier sar systems didn’t have.

You mentiond nuclear vs solar. Yessome older satellites like the Soviet Union's RORSATs had onboard nuclear reactors, but that doesn’t mean they were ""better."" In fact, nuclear-powered satellites posed serious risks. Many nuclear satellites, like RORSATs, fell out of orbit, releasing radioactive material. The infamous Cosmos 954 crash in Canada led to widespread contamination and a costly cleanup. Modern solar panels have improved efficiency and are safer and more sustainable for commercial and government customers.

Nvidia is gonna do like $200b next year. I think like 90% from data centres, so about $3.5B in weekly GPU sales. AMD is expected to do around $10b in GPU sales. So Nvidia will do more sales in the first 3 weeks of January than AMD will do in all of 2025.",40,1732314771.0,t3_1gxj8ob

You say it’s easy for Nvidia to lose 10% market share. Well, let’s look at the numbers. Since AMD rolled out MI300, they’ve gained about 5% market share. This has translated to literally 0% stock market growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia is up another 200% after gaining 250% the previous year. 

I’m not a stock market expert, but my guess is investors feel that AMD market share gain is not large enough when their main competitor is now doing $100b+ worth of annual sales at much higher margins (20 points higher).

If you want to hold AMD, fine. But the same thesis applies to Nvidia (the GPU TAM will grow to $400b+ by 2027), so both companies will benefit.

I agree. Particularly for the Radeon consumer GPUs. But the datacenter GPUs have pretty good support now days. And they are improving. It obviously hasn't been an issue for the $5B GPUs sold. Both Satya (MS/Azure) and Meta have publicly praised the AMD GPUs.

> The point I was thinking was that if to win market share you need to compete on the supply side because the market is supply constrained. This is where Nvidias market cap becomes an asset.

COWOS is temporarily constrained due to a sudden boom. But it's not the most complex process in making GPUs. TSMC doubled the capacity this year. So it's being scaled quickly.

The hardest part in the supply chain is the actual lithography that goes into making the actual silicon chip dies. This is something only TSMC can do to this level of sophistication. And AMD has an ace up their sleeve here. They have mastered the use of chiplets. This gives them higher yields (they get more yield out of each waffer than Nvidia). And they also only use the most advanced node for the performance critical parts of the chip. Non critical things like memory controllers, SRAM (which doesn't scale well with smaller nodes anyway) and PCIE interfaces are done on older nodes.",1,1732393849.0,t1_lymoje7

Also, I just don’t think air taxis are going to be a very profitable market, if it even works at all. I think their primary market will be selling aircraft to those interested. Another limiting factor is that these craft will require a completely different piloting certification. It’s a new type of propulsion, and it’s vtol, transitioning to flying like a plane. The current pilots licenses don’t cover that kind of thing, which means either a new type of license, or a certification that you would need to attain after your fixed wing license.

Another major factor is how these would manage in bad weather, and poor visibility. They’re small craft, and are going to get blown around in high winds.

Chrome has about 66.6% of the market. Even if Edge is installed on 80% of machines, guess what people search for on Edge? Chrome installation. And they search for it with Google. 

And despite the chatgpt, Search revenue is still growing, hitting 12% revenue growth in the latest quarter. Despite that, Google has been heavily investing in AI with their Gemini and AI overviews which personally are really great. 

To me the problem with google now is antitrust. DOJ wants google to sell off Chrome which would really hurt. But google is going to fight it hard. And also, personally, I don't think it makes sense since they lost the lawsuit over anticompetitive practices by paying apple $20B and other browsers to make Google the default.

Otherwise, a company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together. So that users of one product will get Chrome by default.

You are fine if you buy index stocks and DCA with a time horizon of 20-30 years. Markets tend to have 8-15 years of nice returns, then 1 decade or so of chop. See 70's - 80's, then 2000-2010.

What will happen to your high beta portfolio is you will see 80% drawdown when that happens, instead of 30-50%. All stocks go down in a crisis as people scramble for liquidity. Online forums, overpriced pita bread, brokerage correlated to bitcoin, and a luxury carmaker will all get obliterated. And since the market hates you personally, this will be right when you need the cash for a downpayment or a car. You will panic sell just like you are panic buying right now. You will give up, say, well, I should have stuck with indexes, and become an index DCA person like 90% of salaried employees. 

If your time horizon is that long, you should take advantage of high rates as a guaranteed offset until they collapse, which will only happen if there are bad economic times - which is coincidentally the time to buy more indexes.

If Amazon's new upcoming chip even moderately impresses, that is direct hole in NVIDIA earnings. Same for Microsoft. Tesla will stick to NVDA. So data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in, say 2026 or 2027. As next gen chips sales drop, market saturation kicks in to level growth. So I saw it easy to forecast 15 to 145, but 145 to 200 or 145 to 500 seems exponentially riskier to assume as a medium term target. Take Amazon. If Amazon is happy with whatever chips it proposes (even if nowhere near Blackwell levels), that drop in sales would hurt NVIDIA (or just the news). Unless other AI consumers ping Amazon for its chips, they may very well replace Amazon as a NVIDIA client. On the other hand, should NVDA drop to 120s, the P/E becomes a too good to be true, a steal.

lygdth8,gymbeaux6,"The world only needs so many GPUs, but also:

- Several players working to compete with NVIDIA in this space (AMD, Intel, Amazon, et al)

- Companies don’t generally upgrade their hardware whenever something new comes out- AWS and Azure still use Intel CPUs that came out ~7 years ago.

- AI itself is overhyped (like everything before it), and most companies buying Nvidia GPUs to fuck around with AI will end up learning it was a waste of their time and money and won’t be buying Blackwell and beyond (what’s more, those GPUs will probably hit the secondary market).

I train models for a living on two RTX 3090 GPUs connected via NVLink. I bought them about a year ago. ~$700 each, used. I realize companies don’t mind paying $5,000 per-GPU, but main point is you don’t need the latest and greatest and you don’t need a lot of them to “do AI stuff”.",1,1732300371.0,t1_lycpixm

Those providers without bleeding-edge AI solutions just produce much shittier real-world results and are not signing new deals.  In this industry, AI *works*, it produces real-world results that give real-world RoI for broker-dealers who upgrade their monitoring packages to AI-enabled ones.  Fewer review staff, fewer false positives, more defensible compliance posture with the regulatory bodies, and reduced risk of fines for not meeting monitoring requirements.  Those fines can be dozens to hundreds of millions for failure to monitor regulated employees sufficiently, and they are handed out on the regular.

Financial communication monitoring like this is just one of the many, many industries people don't even know exists, and it's pumping money into Nvidia's pockets as fast as Jensen can produce chips for them.  Just in this market sector, there are other groups of providers pouring money into AI to monitor retail transactions directly for AML and sanctions violations.  Yet another group of companies are gobbling up AI for their direct trade surveillance offerings.

There you have 3 entire segments of industry that few laypeople have even heard of, all of which are spending hand over fist on NVDA's chips, and all of whom have positive RoI on that investment because it's just so damn good at what it does.

lyd3o2n,Objective-Turnover70,"the critique is not necessarily about the effectiveness of the drugs but rather about the broader market and financial issues 

the company is not yet profitable, and clinical success does not guarantee commercial success. Many promising drugs fail to translate into meaningful revenue due to regulatory delays, manufacturing, etc. GMP and GDP is hard, and EU regs especially are rough. 

the market for weight-loss drugs is becoming crowded, with established powerhouses like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. wegovy is a meme. Viking will need significant resources to carve out market share.

lastly, the issue of insurance coverage is critical. If insurers are scaling back coverage for weight-loss drugs, even effective treatments may struggle to gain traction, as out-of-pocket costs might soar. major factor limiting the broader adoption of similar therapies!
could the stock moon tho? of course, this shit is all random anyway.",3,1732248349.0,t1_lycwf9z
lydar06,ReindeerApart5536,"Hi thanks for the more detailed responses, but my position is still largely unchanged and several responses:

1: Your first concern only manifests if I choose to hold until commercialization, but I can name in numerous pharma firms who made very promisable profits before even full on commercialization. ie before the full commercialization of its COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna's market valuation surged due to strong Phase 3 trial results, government contracts, and partnerships. Also, BioNTech rose to prominence during its COVID-19 vaccine development with Pfizer, achieving substantial valuation gains after early-stage clinical success. This will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts I provided.

2: The market for Viking is dominating looking as of now. I've responded to someelse to, but here let me restate the comparative advantage of Viking. First is tolerability, for Mounjaro, common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, typical of GLP-1 agonists. But with VK2735, participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms. I'd also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of Mounjaro due to side effects, now compare the frequency to Viking. For Mounjaro, participants achieved an average weight loss of 15-22.5% of body weight over 72 weeks, depending on the dose (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg). This means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame. Compare this to Viking which is NOTABLY only in its Phase 2 mid-stage trial, participants experienced a 15% weight loss over just 13 weeks. Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. These all prove that Viking has a clear comparative edge as of now, unless you can disprove these facts.

3: I think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term. But in the long run, I believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition; it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions. Effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications, so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment. 

If you still maintain your position, I really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day, I'm just an average investor looking for more insights.",1,1732251317.0,t1_lyd3o2n
