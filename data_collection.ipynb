I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company\\'s products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.\\n\\n**About Uber:**\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about Uber\\'s debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I\\'m going to tell you why these things don\\'t even matter.\\n\\nRecently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You\\'d assume this will cut into Uber\\'s profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What\\'s crazy is that they\\'re now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\\\\_uber\\\\_2088\\\\_minimum\\\\_pay\\\\_is\\\\_not\\\\_what\\\\_you\\\\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)\\n\\nAfter going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they\\'re actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I\\'m dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it\\'s customers and charging them a bogus \"service fee\", instead of getting mad at Uber they\\'re getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new \"service fee\" they\\'re paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I\\'ve been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they\\'re pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don\\'t want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.\\n\\nI love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don\\'t give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they\\'re damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you\\'re going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.\\n\\n**Again, I don\\'t read balance sheets ever. Please do inform me on why it matters and why Uber is NOT A GOOD BUY.**'}\n",

Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a\\xa0**timber-trading company**.\\n\\nAlthough it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.\\n\\nAs I’m writing this, its share price is\\xa0**down over 70%**\\xa0from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n  \\n**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**\\n\\n***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***\\n\\nThe company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by\\xa0**acquiring**\\xa0many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.\\n\\n***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***\\n\\nIn 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:\\n\\n* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)\\n* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)\\n* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)\\n* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)\\n* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)\\n\\nThe transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of\\xa0**Gucci Group,**\\xa0100% of\\xa0**Boucheron,**\\xa0and 100% of\\xa0**Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.\\n\\nFrançois-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.\\n\\nIt is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).\\n\\nIts portfolio is quite diversified and includes:\\n\\n* High-end clothing\\n* Footwear\\n* Handbags and leather goods\\n* Sunglasses and eyewear\\n* Scarves & other fashion accessories\\n* Jewelry\\n* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)\\n* Cosmetics (in early stage)\\n* Watches\\n\\nIt is also geographically diversified:\\n\\n* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue\\n* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue\\n* **North America**: 23% of revenue\\n* **Japan**: 8% of revenue\\n* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue\\n\\n**3.0 Historical financial performance**\\n\\nIts revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. \\n\\nKering’s gross margin is stable at \\\\~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.\\n\\nHowever, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.\\n\\n**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**\\n\\nWhen there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.\\n\\nScaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.\\n\\nThe company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.\\n\\n||all numbers in €m|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|\\n|Operating cash flow|€21.541|\\n|Capex|(€7.772)|\\n|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|\\n|Debt|€4.887|\\n|Share buyback|(€2.034)|\\n|Dividends|(€8.229)|\\n|Other|€25|\\n|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|\\n\\nBetween 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated\\xa0**over €21.5 billion**\\xa0in operating cash flow, or\\xa0**a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**\\n\\nClose to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.\\n\\nWhy do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:\\n\\n1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.\\n2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from\\xa0**€7.1 billion**\\xa0in 2019 to\\xa0**€15.4 billion**\\xa0as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \\\\~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4.0 What can be expected?**\\n\\nBased on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:\\n\\n* Organic growth;\\n* Shareholder return; and\\n* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.\\n\\nAll of it, while having a\\xa0**healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**\\n\\nThis is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:\\n\\n1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company\\xa0**with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of\\xa0**acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**\\n2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion**\\xa0in 2019 to\\xa0**€15.4 billion**\\xa0as of June 30th, 2024).\\n3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).\\n\\n**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**\\n\\n  \\n**5.0 Dividends**\\n\\nThe dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \\\\~6%.\\n\\nIf the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.\\n\\n  \\n**6.0 High employee turnover**\\n\\nAt the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were\\xa0**13,403**\\xa0new hires, and\\xa0**11,275**\\xa0employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.\\n\\nThis sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.\\n\\nIn theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).\\n\\nIn addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.\\n\\nGiven the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.\\n\\n  \\n**7.0 The concerns**\\n\\n**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**\\n\\nBack in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.\\n\\nThis brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.\\n\\nIn addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.\\n\\n**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**\\n\\nIn April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.\\n\\nAn investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.\\n\\nThe investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.\\n\\n  \\n**8.0 Valuation** \\n\\nThis is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:\\n\\n* **Revenue**\\xa0\\\\- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \\\\~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.\\n* **Operating margin**\\xa0\\\\- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.\\n\\nBased on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \\\\~9%), the fair value of the company is\\xa0**€27 billion (€220/share)**\\xa0which is very close to the current price of\\xa0**€224/share**.\\n\\nThis offers an IRR of \\\\~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.\\n\\n  \\n**8.1 The Bull Case**\\n\\nThose who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:\\n\\n* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;\\n* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;\\n* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;\\n* Positive macro tailwinds;\\n\\n* Utilizing pricing power;\\n* Integration of recent acquisitions;\\n* Reducing operating costs;\\n\\n**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**\\n\\n\\n\\n**8.2 The Bear Case**\\n\\nThose who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:\\n\\n* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;\\n* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;\\n* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;\\n* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;\\n* Negative macro tailwinds;\\n* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;\\n* Supply chain issues;\\n* Competitive pressure;\\n* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities\\n\\n**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**\\n\\n\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.'}\n",

This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.\\n\\nThe DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.\\n\\nRivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.\\n\\n\"This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,\" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. \"This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability.

They were a lot less liable to downvote simply because of a disagreement. \\n\\n> When you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it, i think it’s a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page.\\n\\nWhy?? \\n\\nThis literally means that in a thread about a topic where 60% of commenters think *x* and 40% think *y*, you’ll basically only see *x* because *y* gets downvoted. This is how echo chambers persist.  It means you’re always seeing the most popular take. Is that really how conversations should be?\\n\\n> Whats social media ISNT an echo chamber \\n\\n\\nClassic Internet forums are much more akin to real life conversations because they’re chronological order. Twitter has the “community notes” feature where a viewpoint doesn’t have to be 50%+ to get posted at the top, it just has to be rated as helpful by enough people, and since the platform’s algorithm seeks engagement, often controversial or disagreement takes are right under the original tweet. Reddit is definitely the most powerful echo chamber factory.', 'score': 15, 'created': 1732821705.0, 'parent_id': 't1_lzf05r7'}\n",

They will squeeze a ton of revenue out of x86 for many years, but it's ultimately stagnant at *best*.\\n\\n* Intel has been trying to diversify into the discrete GPU market.  Unfortunately, it just leaked yesterday that their new B770 die hasn't even taped out yet, and both performance and thermals are way below expectations.  It may never see the light of day, which means Intel will have no serious discrete GPU offering this generation.\\n\\n* Both AMD and NVDA are burning the midnight oil to release their Windows-on-ARM APU's by Xmas 2025.  More WoA is bad for Intel, not just for CPU sales, but for x86 licensing fees.  No one knows yet if WoA will impact x86 sales seriously, but it's a real possibility for the 24-36 month horizon.\\n\\n* The one thing Intel has *really* done right lately - Lunar Lake - is being changed significantly in the next gen.  They are moving RAM off-die to save $$ and reduce the cost to market to be more competitive with... you guessed it... ARM APU's.  It's a real gamble.

The government created a program to encourage a behavior, in this program it also discourages another behavior.  It is a government incentive (subsidy) to produce electric cars.  The credits are handed out by the government, and they let the market decide how much it is worth.   Therefore, the government is indirectly paying companies to produce electric cars by mandating a quota against ICE vehicles sold.    This effectively subsidizes the price of an electric vehicle.  It’s actually a beautiful subsidy from an economics perspective because of the “free market” aspect - companies can decide the balance of ICE vs EV, and pay for their externalities by purchasing credits from others.  If all companies decide to meet the regulation on their own, the subsidy is effectively worth zero because the goal has been met.  \\n\\nIf the government taxed emissions and used that tax money to distribute it to EV manufacturers, you would consider that a subsidy.  In emissions trading, companies opt to buy credits in lieu of fines from manufacturers with surplus. The money is changing hands still, the behavior is still be incentivized, it is just the market deciding the price.  Regardless, they are both government regulations in an attempt to price a negative externality and incentivize (subsidize) a behavior. \\n\\n2.

I'm not super familiar with the process of convertible bonds.\\n\\nThe attraction to MSTR is that they are going to issue more zero-coupon bonds, and use that to buy more bitcoin.  So instead of buying 1 bitcoin, you could buy 1-bitcoin worth of shares worth of MSTR.  As you rightly point out, the 1-bitcoin-worth-of-MSTR-shares costs much more (like 3 or 4 times the value of the company's bitcoin). The idea is the 1-bitcoin is always worth the price of 1-bitcoin, whatever it may be.  Meanwhile, MSTR is basically getting free money on the promise of higher stock prices, which they turn into more bitcoin. \\n\\nSo let's say you buy 1000 shares of MSTR now at $400,000, which is worth 1 bitcoin, or $95,000.  The company is going to increase their holdings of bitcoin by 5-10fold, which means you'll have $480,000 to $950,000 worth of bitcoin in the future.  So your $400,000 worth of MSTR looks cheap by comparison.\\n\\nI can't believe I'm defending MSTR, but here we are.\\n\\nSo what's the hole to poke in this argument?  I'd say that MSTR, by issuing this convertible bonds, is diluting their share count.  So if your 1000 shares currently entitle you to 1 bitcoin worth of shares in the company, in the future you might be diluted 2 or 3 times, so your shares are only worth .5 bitcoin or .33 bitcoin.  Now, when they increase their holdings 5-10 fold.... you'll have 5\\\\*.4 to 10\\\\*.4 bitcoin, or about 3 bitcoin worth of shares.\\n\\n3 bitcoin times 95,000 = 285,000, or a MSTR shareprice of $285.\\n\\nSo MSTR is still severely overvalued.

Of course, that ignores the fact that a market maker can put their thumb on the scale, but mechanically, that\\'s the idea. \\n\\nIf millions of people flip their 401k to auto-invest on broad indexes like the S&P 500, do you think that every 2 weeks they are checking to make sure that APPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, etc. are all at an \"appropriate\" value based on cash flows? Of course not. So that right there shows how there can be a huge demand for tickers with zero regard for fundamental analysis.\\n\\n\"Meme Stock\" is a nonsense term meant to degrade the sentiment (and ultimately value) of stocks that large institutions have short positions on. Their crazy volatility is almost never due to actual \"crazed\" retail sentiment alone - and in reality, it\\'s completely undefined. Was Tootsie Roll a meme stock? It had huge amounts of short interest and moved along with gamestop and other \"memes\" during their runups, and was written about as a meme in several articles like [this one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/01/27/not-just-gamestop-here-are-the-meme-stocks-wallstreetbets-traders-are-pumping-up-during-this-extremely-erratic-reddit-rally/).  Meanwhile they are profitable quarter after quarter and have a healthy balance sheet - was it really \"crazed redditors\" that caused them to spike in cycles just like the other memes? Did you personally see a lot of Tootsie Roll memes and posts on reddit?\\n\\nMy point is this; cash flow is one factor in determining a stocks value, but it is not the only one and to pretend that there is some calculation you can do to get the \"proper\" value of a stock would mean that sentiment, future prospects, and market mechanics in general play no role. It\\'s a silly stance, quite frankly.', 'score': 4, 'created': 1732632072.0, 'parent_id': 't1_lz1qqu6'}\n",

Plus, Chromium is open source, so it wouldn't be that difficult for Google to simply start a new browser unless the ruling forbids them from doing so.\\n\\nSo I'm not sure how selling Chrome is realistic or helpful when it comes to stopping monopolies. Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.\\n\\nAllowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance. I could see those happening.\\n\\nUltimately, I'm wondering how much Google's search business will end up impacted by the rise of ChatGPT, especially with OpenAI also dipping directly into search. I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. \\n\\nGoogle might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer. A negative feeling towards a company also makes consumers less willing to expand the number of products from that company they're using, which will perhaps work against Google as they try to compete in the AI space.\\n\\nOf course, Google has mountains of money and resources, so writing them off is risky.\", 'score': 14, 'created': 1732476210.0, 'parent_id': 't1_lyrz1br'}\n",

Also, BioNTech rose to prominence during its COVID-19 vaccine development with Pfizer, achieving substantial valuation gains after early-stage clinical success. This will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts I provided.\\n\\n2: The market for Viking is dominating looking as of now. I've responded to someelse to, but here let me restate the comparative advantage of Viking. First is tolerability, for Mounjaro, common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, typical of GLP-1 agonists. But with VK2735, participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms. I'd also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of Mounjaro due to side effects, now compare the frequency to Viking. For Mounjaro, participants achieved an average weight loss of 15-22.5% of body weight over 72 weeks, depending on the dose (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg). This means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame. Compare this to Viking which is NOTABLY only in its Phase 2 mid-stage trial, participants experienced a 15% weight loss over just 13 weeks. Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. These all prove that Viking has a clear comparative edge as of now, unless you can disprove these facts.\\n\\n3: I think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term. But in the long run, I believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition; it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions. Effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications, so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment. \\n\\nIf you still maintain your position, I really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day, I'm just an average investor looking for more insights.\", 'score': 1, 'created': 1732251317.0, 'parent_id': 't1_lyd3o2n'}\n",
